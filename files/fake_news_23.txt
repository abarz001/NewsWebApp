In the ad, Trumps 34-year-old daughter, who is pregnant with her third child, sat at a desk in a messy office with a city view and magazine clippings of herself propped up in the window. 

I am Ivanka Trump and Im very excited that this Saturday the 20th is the Republican primary in South Carolina. We are all gonna be there, my whole family, obviously my father, my siblings, and myself, she said.   </source>    

Ivanka Trump, who is pregnant with her third child, recorded a video message for her father Friday

Ivankas father Donald Trump is expected to win tomorrows Republican primary election in South Carolina

We are all gonna be there, my whole family, obviously my father, my siblings, and myself, Ivanka said

The jewelry designer and executive at the Trump Organization said the energy, the passion, the excitement, the momentum in South Carolina has really been unparalleled.

And were looking forward to that translating that into your vote on Saturday, said Ivanka.

Ivanka made seven campaign stops ahead of Tuesdays primary, traveling to New Hampshire even though she is eight months pregnant. 

And after it was revealed that Donald had won the New Hampshire primarily, Ivanka proudly stoon on stage with her dad during his victory speech, in which he thanked Ivanka and the rest of his family. 

According to a Fox News poll released Friday, the blonde billionaire has no reason to worry about winning South Carolina.

If the poll is correct, Trump will win over around 32 percent of likely Republican voters, as compared to his nearest rival Ted Cruz, who would end up with 20 percent.
