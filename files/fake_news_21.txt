The woman was rewatching home security footage of her dogs when she believed she spotted a “ghost” intervention. Sharing the clip, she urged people to pay close attention to her black dog.

“Sorry for the obnoxious barking at the beginning. Watch my black dog. [A] ghost takes her collar off in her crate,” she wrote in the video’s caption.

In the video, you see the two dogs, who are in separate crates barking at each other in what appears to be a living room.RecommendedTikTok has a new Squid Game filter - and it’s even scarier than the robot dollMan receives bizarre text from date’s mum - but it’s weirder than it first seemsMum reveals huge difference in size 14 jeans despite buying from same shop

Both dogs bark profusely until around the 23-second mark in the video when the pups ceased all noise, standing alert for a moment.

The black dog, who is in the crate to the right begins to whimper and then suddenly jumps back into a corner of the crate, seemingly trying to avoid something once its collar randomly pops off.

It was at this moment that the owner was certain that a ‘ghost’ was responsible—and others agreed.

Since the video was posted, it accrued over 1.3 million views at the time of writing and over 43,600 comments from people who think it’s a ghost as well.

“They both got super quiet...they felt the energy,” someone wrote.

“I’ve never seen such a convincing ghost video,” another added while a third noted that a seeming entity messing with dogs “doesn’t sit right” with them.

On the other hand, others believed there were logical explanations as to why the collar magically came off, with some saying that it was “stiff fabric” that caused the collar to unclasp or it simply “came off by accident and the dog got scared.”

No matter what transpired, it’s safe to say that the case of the fallen collar appeared to be creepy nonetheless.More About: TikTokGhost       back to topUser PoliciesPrivacyCookiesFeedbackAbout indy100ArchiveTrending Elon Musk wants to open a university with a very immature name2021-10-29T11:02:22.000ZAmazon driver fired after video of woman leaving his van goes viral2021-10-31T11:42:15.000ZMelania gave a priceless facial expression after looking at Trump2021-10-31T14:09:07.000ZMan criticised for shaming his wife for bleeding after giving birth2021-10-31T13:28:32.000ZWoman shocked after she found out she was pregnant on the toilet2021-10-30T16:13:20.000ZSister accused of ‘upstaging’ bride after 100-pound weight loss2021-11-01T09:01:29.000ZMAFS Australia’s Jessika Power reveals her hilarious UK bucket list2021-10-29T15:13:44.000ZCaitlyn Jenner: Dave Chappelle is ‘100% right’ in Netflix row2021-10-28T08:10:36.000ZWhen do the clocks go back and will we lose or gain an hour of sleep?2021-10-30T11:22:32.000ZWoman discovers she’s accidentally been exposing herself to neighbours2021-10-29T09:26:29.000ZWoman claims her life is harder because she is ‘attractive’2021-11-01T09:39:36.000ZBabysitter who called cops on mom questions if she did the right thing2021-10-30T08:09:01.000ZBoris Johnson at the G20 Summit has sparked Benny Hill comparisons2021-10-31T10:36:20.000ZWhy was there a bottle of BBQ sauce in Zuckerberg’s Meta presentation?2021-10-29T08:35:55.000ZInfluencer sparks outrage posing for photos on Holocaust memorial2021-11-02T08:24:05.000ZWhatsApp will get blocked on millions of phones next week2021-10-27T13:27:16.000ZKeanu Reeves filmed helping John Wick production crew move equipment2021-10-29T14:49:14.000Z10 of the best celebrity Halloween costumes of 20212021-11-02T09:04:53.000ZTrump Jr just self-owned his father over the Tomahawk chop controversy2021-11-01T12:21:15.000Z‘Halloween Kills’ accused of homophobia due to murder of a gay couple2021-10-29T15:20:08.000ZDad praised for respectful way he takes daughter into women’s loos2021-10-28T14:33:41.000ZAmazon driver praised for perfectly following delivery instructions2021-10-26T07:41:10.000ZTrump caught laughing at ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ chant at baseball game2021-11-01T10:23:46.000ZFunniest memes and jokes about Facebook changing its name to ‘Meta’2021-10-29T07:37:18.000ZRare ‘penis plant’ blooms for first time in nearly 25 years2021-10-27T16:18:44.000ZMan jailed for disguising himself and taking driving tests for others2021-05-31T07:21:22.000ZWoman asks neighbours for help to catch her ‘cheating’ boyfriend2021-10-30T08:03:43.000ZBoris Johnson’s Roman Empire comments trigger backlash from historians2021-10-31T16:54:36.000Z‘Let’s Go Brandon’: the new meme MAGA fans are using against Biden2021-10-10T10:55:32.000ZMan with ‘world’s largest penis’ reveals all2021-08-06T15:53:04.000ZMarvel’s Eternals flooded with homophobic reviews because of gay hero2021-10-28T16:43:24.000ZThe difference between Trump and Biden in just 14 seconds2021-11-01T14:16:23.000ZTalkRadio host doubles down on viral claim that ‘concrete grows’2021-10-26T19:18:49.000ZRestaurant worker says she was told to seat ‘ugly’ people in the back2021-10-30T11:07:45.000ZThe funniest concrete memes in reaction to that talkRadio interview2021-10-27T09:03:04.000ZTikTok swinger reveals that she lets her husband and mother have sex2021-10-05T16:18:44.000ZAmerican Airlines plane diverted after flight attendant ‘punched’2021-10-29T12:02:50.000ZTikToker posts pictures to prove how fake social media can be2021-11-01T17:17:45.000ZGordon Ramsay finally speaks out after radio host calls Tilly ‘chubby’2021-10-28T13:36:17.000ZWoman eats 23 ‘poop pills’ from donor with ‘stomach of steel’2021-11-01T19:02:24.000ZRepublican’s attempt to troll Greta Thunberg completely backfires2021-11-02T10:18:29.000ZPhoto of PM maskless next to David Attenborough causes uproar2021-11-02T14:47:12.000Z10 years ago Kim Kardashian divorced Kris Humphries after 72 days2021-10-31T10:27:30.000ZI ate gold-wrapped food for a day to channel my inner Salt Bae2021-10-27T13:14:54.000ZMike Pompeo looks unrecognizable after dramatic weight loss2021-10-29T00:04:51.000ZCyclist smashes into woman on phone as he races towards finish line2021-10-27T08:14:25.000ZHusband made his wife ‘guess’ which family member had died2021-11-02T12:30:07.000ZFrench EU politician gives a very honest opinion on Brexit2021-10-27T17:51:54.000ZFour Seasons Total Landscaping are back trolling Rudy Giuliani again2021-11-01T09:22:33.000ZPresident Joe Biden appears to fall asleep during COP speeches2021-11-01T15:32:26.000ZMan accused of shaming Tinder date who paid for her meal with coins2021-10-25T17:51:02.000ZWoman questions if her dog tattoo looks like a penis2021-10-30T12:24:02.000ZTeenager’s homecoming dress sparks debate after backlash on Facebook2021-10-26T15:32:59.000ZToys ‘R’ Us is coming back -
