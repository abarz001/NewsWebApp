Gabby Petitos body was found on Sept. 19 near Wyomings Grand Teton National Park   By Janine Puhak   September 28, 2021 12:44 PM        Advertisement   FB    Tweet    More      Pinterest     Email     Send Text Message     Print           Gabby Petito in music video        Credit: Irreplaceable/Youtube  

Eight years before her death, Gabby Petito appeared in a music video that raises awareness about violence against children and victims of gun violence. 

Deb Henson of Long Island, New York released &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; &#x2014; a visual that has since resurfaced amid news of Petito&apos;s death &#x2014; a year after the 2012&#xA0;Sandy Hook&#xA0;Elementary School&#xA0;shooting in Newton, Connecticut, News 12 Bronx reported. Henson, a singer and songwriter, produced and performed the emotional track in a music video that a 14-year-old Gabby and her stepbrothers Joseph and Derek Petito also appeared in.

&quot;It&apos;s not easy getting by, living each day without you. No one knows the way that I feel, the depth of being alone,&quot; the ballad begins. The footage follows an adult woman walking alone on a beach, remembering visions of a young son she lost, alluding to an unseen school shooting after scenes of a busy morning and drop-off. 

Later in the clip, other children hold up signs with messages like &quot;I deserve a future,&quot; &quot;No more violence against kids&quot; and &quot;Protect us.&quot; Then, a teenage Petito makes a cameo, lounging in the grass with a notepad and later holding up a sign reading &quot;I&apos;m irreplaceable.&quot;      Gabby Petito in music video        Credit: Irreplaceable/Youtube

Reflecting on production, Henson told PEOPLE the video was shot over a picture-perfect weekend in Long Island and that the lyrics hit harder than ever in the wake of Petito&apos;s death at age 22. 

&quot;Watching the video now truly breaks my heart, and has had a profound effect on me. It&apos;s hard to comprehend how and why [she died],&quot; Henson says. &quot;I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about Gabby since I found out.&quot;       

While filming the video with the Petito kids and other children from the neighborhood, the singer said that Gabby lifted everyone&apos;s spirits with her bright personality. 

&quot;Working with Gabby was awesome. She was just a sweet girl who wanted to help and be involved,&quot; Henson says. &quot;She was full of love for everyone. I think that&apos;s why this story has resonated. You can feel her love for life.&quot;  

&quot;It&apos;s profound and ironic that she was in this specific video,&quot; she continues. &quot;Her family are good people and don&apos;t deserve such agony and tragedy, no one does. I know her family will find the positive eventually and do great things in the name of Gabby.&quot;     Gabby Petito        Credit: Joseph Petito Twitter 

Now, Henson has rededicated the song in the young woman&apos;s honor, and pledged to donate all proceeds from downloads of &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; to the Gabby Petito Foundation.&#xA0;  

On Sept. 19, authorities announced that the body found in Grand Teton National Park over the weekend has been positively identified as Gabby, who was&#xA0;last heard from in late August&#xA0;during a cross-country road trip with her fianc&#xE9;, Brian Laundrie. 

According to a tweet by the&#xA0;FBI&apos;s Denver field office, Petito died by homicide. Authorities have not released a cause of death, but named Laundrie as a person of interest.

&quot;The FBI and our partners remain dedicated to ensuring anyone responsible for or complicit in Ms. Petito&apos;s death is held accountable for their actions,&quot; Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider said in the FBI&apos;s tweet. 

Schneider added that Laundrie is a person of interest, saying, &quot;Anyone with information concerning Mr. Laundrie&apos;s role in this matter or his current whereabouts should contact the FBI.&quot;  

Laundrie is now&#xA0;wanted by the FBI&#xA0;on an active arrest warrant issued last week on allegations of unauthorized use of a debit card. He has been the subject of a massive manhunt. 

Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11 &#x2014; 10 days after Laundrie quietly returned to his parents&apos; Florida home without her &#x2014; prompting a search through the Wyoming wilderness where authorities believe she was last seen. 

During the search, unusual details about the case continued to emerge, turning one family&apos;s nightmare into a nationwide demand for answers.
