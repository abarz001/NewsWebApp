 </H5>        This one&rsquo;s for die hard Simpsons fans only. If you think you&rsquo;re a superfan who can binge all 33 seasons of the classic animated series in eight weeks, this UK company has a job for you.

The Simpsons have had the eerie ability to predict the future, and  wants to get as many clues as possible about what to expect in 2022. That&rsquo;s why the company is offering one lucky person $6,800 to binge every episode of the series and report back their findings.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a well-known phenomenon that&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;have predicted the news, from Donald Trump as president, to the most recent panic buying of fuel in the UK,&rdquo; said Philip Wicinski, U.K. Country Manager at PlatinCasino.co.uk. &ldquo;After a hard couple of years, we at PlatinCasino.co.uk are intrigued to see what 2022 will hold.

&ldquo;So ahead of the new year, we thought what better way than putting&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;to the test and seeing if, after searching each series, we can predict what the next year, and future, has in store for us.&rdquo;

Here are the details:

The chosen applicant (18+) will be given the task of watching The Simpsons for 35.5 hours a week for 8 weeks, watching all 284 hours plus the 2007 movie. During each episode, you will be asked to take notes on stand out storylines that could turn into future predictions.

Compensation will be $6,800 which works out to be around &nbsp;$9.25 an episode. PlatinCasino.co.uk will also pay for your Disney+ subscription and wifi during that time. Plus, you&rsquo;ll get a weekly supply of Homer&rsquo;s famous, favorite snack, Lard Lad Donuts to enjoy while you watch.
