The reference is to the Thursday slaying of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was hit by discharge from a prop gun while working on the Baldwin film “Rust.”     Advertisement       \n\n Baldwin, the film’s star, was handling the weapon from which the fatal shot was fired. The movie’s director was injured as well.

Last year, he hosted an Alaskan hunting trip to raise money for Safari Club International.                  Advertisement       \n\n The t-shirt Trump Jr. is pushing is in line with anti-Baldwin comments the former reality TV judge made on social media over the weekend. He suggested Sunday that Baldwin, a politically active progressive, would blame the gun for Hutchins’ being shot. Some like-minded Instagram users weighed in to suggest — without any evidence — that the killing was no accident.   \n\n Trump Jr. stuck to his guns amid criticism the t-shirt was in poor taste.             \n\n “Screw all the sanctimony I’m seeing out there,” he said on Instagram. “If the shoe was on the other foot Alex (sic) Baldwin would literally be the first person p--sing on everybody’s grave trying to make a point. F*ck him!”   \n\n As of Monday former President Donald Trump, who announced last week he was launching a new social media platform, had not commented on the matter.        \n\n But some right-wing pundits teed up on Baldwin after Hutchins’ death. Commentator Candace Owens accused Baldwin of the “murder” of “innocent people,” which she later corrected.          This t-shirt, which appears to mock the death of a woman on the set of a western starring Alec Baldwin, is being sold on a website linked to Donald Trump Jr.      \n\n GOP Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert and Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance mocked Baldwin, with the latter asking that Donald Trump be reinstated on Twitter so he could address his TV tormentor.   \n\n Those comments drew fire from Vance’s Democratic rival in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan, who tweeted “Someone died, you a--hole.”   \n\n Even Fox News host Janice Dean urged Vance to take down his tweet.     \n\n Baldwin’s impression of Trump on “SNL” angered the ex-president, who questioned the long-running program’s legality in a 2018 Twitter rant about “unfair news coverage.”   \n\n Trump and Baldwin feuded on Twitter in March of that year with the 45th president claiming the actor’s “dying mediocre career” was revived by his impersonation of the commander-in-chief.

He had reportedly been told the firearm was “cold.”   \n\n According to a new affidavit, Baldwin was training his pistol on a camera when the shot was fired from his gun. “Rust” director Joel Souza reportedly claimed Baldwin was rehearsing a “cross draw” at the time of the killing. The filmmaker said he was looking over Hutchins’ shoulder and heard “a whip and then loud pop” before the two of them were struck.     \n\n CNN reported camera operator Reid Russell heard Hutchins say she could not “feel her legs” as medics tried in vain to keep her alive. He also said in an affidavit that Baldwin “had been very careful” handling the gun on set.

See all newsletters.          \n\n Hilaria Baldwin, the 63-year-old actor’s wife, tweeted Monday her sympathies for Hutchins, her family and her own husband, as well.   \n\n “My heart is with Halyna,” she wrote Monday on Instagram. “Her husband. Her son. Their family and loved ones. And my Alec.”     Howard Stern mocks the ‘wisdom’ of Donald Trump Jr.: You can’t argue with a genius like that’ »     \n\n A pair of vigils were held for Hutchins over the weekend. One took place in New Mexico, where she died. The other took place in Burbank, Calif., outside the International Cinematographers Guild. Her death inspired a push for safer film sets where guns are used.   \n\n People magazine reported a “hysterical and absolutely inconsolable” Baldwin had pulled out of upcoming projects while he tried to pull himself together. The victim’s husband, Matthew Hutchins, was photographed hugging Baldwin outside a Santa Fe Hotel where they’d reportedly met.

Hutchins and her husband were married 16 years and have a 9-year-old son.

Does Amazon Spray Boxes With Chemicals Dangerous to Pets?  	2021-01-25	                    	As billions of holiday packages made their way around the world during the 2020 holiday season, a post shared to social media in late December claimed that packages distributed by Amazon were sprayed with chemicals that may be harmful to pets.\n\nA Dec. 27 Facebook post shared by the New York-based charity Uptown Cat Rescue warned pet owners that “ALL” boxes are sprayed with “toxic pesticides to kill wearouse [sic] rodents\n\nAllegations involving packaging materials and pet illnesses around the holiday season are rare, but have surfaced before this one. Claims that sprayed-on chemicals could cause chemical burns in some pets circulated through social media in a variety of platforms and methods, including Reddit and Twitter. In particular, Snopes readers sent our team the below post shared by a woman named Debora Berger with the Facebook group Yorkie Lovers.\n\nBerger told Snopes that she had contacted the original poster — a woman by the name of Alicia Plant — who first shared the pictures of her cat that had allegedly experienced chemical burns after licking Amazon boxes. Snopes subsequently contacted Plant, who confirmed that she had initially shared the photo to social media but had since deleted it.\n\n“I don’t want to bash Amazon. I love Amazon and I have deleted my post bc of all the hate,” Plant told Snopes in a Facebook message. “Amazon and I have been in contact and I do not wish to speak about it as it is being handled by them. Have a nice day.”\n\nIn an interview with Snopes, Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that the company does not have a policy of spraying their packaging boxes with any sort of rodenticide or insecticide.\n\n“Boxes aren’t sprayed for any reason. If somewhere down the supply chain are they sprayed? The answer to that is no,” said Seay. “Corrugated boxes are made of wood pulp and wood pulp binders, which is basically what all manufacturers make their boxes out of. So, we don’t have special boxes. They are essentially the same thing that every other manufacturer uses.”\n\nCorrugated cardboard boxes are made of paper and represent one of the most recycled products in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Garbage and recycling service provider Waste Management noted that corrugated shipping boxes like those used by Amazon are made of recycled materials or lumber industry byproducts, such as sawdust. When recycled, cardboard materials are re-pulped, separated, bleached, and screened and cleaned to eliminate contaminants.\n\nIn 2019, it was estimated that Amazon shipped around 2.5 billion packages around the world every year. But during the 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic, Amazon upped its global shipping fleet and expanded its shipping flight activity by at least 30% since April 2020, according to a report published in September by the Chicago-based Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development.\n\n\r\n          			                                                                                                                        Esquimalt and Nanaimo will join ban on single-use plastic bags                                                                                                                            Forgo Plastic: 16-Year-Old From Pune Makes And Distributes Paper Bags To Stop The Usage Of Plastic                                                                                                          		          	                                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                                               	  	\n\nQUICK LINKS  	  	  	 	Home   	Our&nbsp;Service   	About U  s  	Products &nbsp;Case   	Contact Us                                                               	  	\n\nABOUT US  	  	  	 	Paper Gift Bags   	Paper box   	Wrapping paper   	Gift Tissue Paper   	Party Decoration                                                                            	  	\n\nCONTACT US  	  	  	Contact Person : Miss Gloria Bao\n\nTel : +86-579-85792908\n\nE-mail : sales1@jialanpackage.com\n\nWechat : +86-18757869290\r\n Whatsapp :+86-18757869290                                                         Sitemap                                                                                                                                                          \n\nCopyright © 2021 Yiwu Jialan Package Co, LTD. | All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Get This APP                                                                                                                                                              	 		 					 				 					  					facebook 				 			 					 				 					  					twitter 				 			 					 				 					  					youtube 				 			 					 				 					  					linkedin 				 			 					 				 					  					instagram 				 			 					 				 					  					pinterest 				 			 				 	    	 	  	 		 			 		 		Chat Online  		编辑模式下无法使用 	 	 		 			 			Chat Online  			inputting...

He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!’&rdquo;                                 — Donald Trump\n\nThat’s former President Donald Trump, who seemed to be slightly bitter at former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who died on Monday of complications from COVID-19. \r\n\r\nTrump, who delivered the remarks via email, diverged from the many notable politicians, who praised the former military leader. Here are the former president’s remarks in full:       – October 19, 2021 –                    Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America                   Wonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media. Hope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO, if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\n\nTrump’s antipathy may stem from the 2016 election, when Powell, a longtime Republican, publicly announced that he would be voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton, and not Trump, going on to endorse Joe Biden in 2020. Just before his death, Powell blamed Trump for the Jan. 6 events at the Capitol, telling Bob Woodward, “He was going in there to overturn the government.” \r\n\r\nHe added, according to Woodward: “Trump refuses to acknowledge that he wasn’t re-elected.

(Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images) The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives the world over for more than a year. Its death toll will soon reach three million people. Yet the origin of pandemic remains uncertain: The political agendas of governments and scientists have generated thick clouds of obfuscation, which the mainstream press seems helpless to dispel.\n\nIn what follows I will sort through the available scientific facts, which hold many clues as to what happened, and provide readers with the evidence to make their own judgments. I will then try to assess the complex issue of blame, which starts with, but extends far beyond, the government of China.\n\nBy the end of this article, you may have learned a lot about the molecular biology of viruses. I will try to keep this process as painless as possible. But the science cannot be avoided because for now, and probably for a long time hence, it offers the only sure thread through the maze.\n\nThe virus that caused the pandemic is known officially as SARS-CoV-2, but can be called SARS2 for short. As many people know, there are two main theories about its origin. One is that it jumped naturally from wildlife to people. The other is that the virus was under study in a lab, from which it escaped. It matters a great deal which is the case if we hope to prevent a second such occurrence.\n\nI&rsquo;ll describe the two theories, explain why each is plausible, and then ask which provides the better explanation of the available facts. It&rsquo;s important to note that so far there is no direct evidence for either theory. Each depends on a set of reasonable conjectures but so far lacks proof. So I have only clues, not conclusions, to offer. But those clues point in a specific direction. And having inferred that direction, I&rsquo;m going to delineate some of the strands in this tangled skein of disaster.\n\nA tale of two theories. After the pandemic first broke out in December 2019, Chinese authorities reported that many cases had occurred in the wet market &mdash; a place selling wild animals for meat &mdash; in Wuhan. This reminded experts of the SARS1 epidemic of 2002, in which a bat virus had spread first to civets, an animal sold in wet markets, and from civets to people. A similar bat virus caused a second epidemic, known as MERS, in 2012. This time the intermediary host animal was camels.\n\nThe decoding of the virus&rsquo;s genome showed it belonged a viral family known as beta-coronaviruses, to which the SARS1 and MERS viruses also belong. The relationship supported the idea that, like them, it was a natural virus that had managed to jump from bats, via another animal host, to people. The wet market connection, the major point of similarity with the SARS1 and MERS epidemics, was soon broken: Chinese researchers found earlier cases in Wuhan with no link to the wet market. But that seemed not to matter when so much further evidence in support of natural emergence was expected shortly.\n\nWuhan, however, is home of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading world center for research on coronaviruses. So the possibility that the SARS2 virus had escaped from the lab could not be ruled out. Two reasonable scenarios of origin were on the table.\n\nFrom early on, public and media perceptions were shaped in favor of the natural emergence scenario by strong statements from two scientific groups. These statements were not at first examined as critically as they should have been.\n\n&ldquo;We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,&rdquo; a group of virologists and others wrote in the Lancet on February 19, 2020, when it was really far too soon for anyone to be sure what had happened. Scientists &ldquo;overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,&rdquo; they said, with a stirring rallying call for readers to stand with Chinese colleagues on the frontline of fighting the disease.\n\nContrary to the letter writers&rsquo; assertion, the idea that the virus might have escaped from a lab invoked accident, not conspiracy. It surely needed to be explored, not rejected out of hand. A defining mark of good scientists is that they go to great pains to distinguish between what they know and what they don&rsquo;t know. By this criterion, the signatories of the Lancet letter were behaving as poor scientists: They were assuring the public of facts they could not know for sure were true.\n\nIt later turned out that the Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak&rsquo;s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If the SARS2 virus had indeed escaped from research he funded, Daszak would be potentially culpable. This acute conflict of interest was not declared to the Lancet&rsquo;s readers. To the contrary, the letter concluded, &ldquo;We declare no competing interests.&rdquo;         Peter Daszak, a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus, talks on his cellphone at the Hilton Wuhan Optics Valley in Wuhan. (Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nVirologists like Daszak had much at stake in the assigning of blame for the pandemic. For 20 years, mostly beneath the public&rsquo;s attention, they had been playing a dangerous game. In their laboratories they routinely created viruses more dangerous than those that exist in nature. They argued that they could do so safely, and that by getting ahead of nature they could predict and prevent natural &ldquo;spillovers,&rdquo; the cross-over of viruses from an animal host to people. If SARS2 had indeed escaped from such a laboratory experiment, a savage blowback could be expected, and the storm of public indignation would affect virologists everywhere, not just in China. &ldquo;It would shatter the scientific edifice top to bottom,&rdquo; an MIT Technology Review editor, Antonio Regalado, said in March 2020.\n\nA second statement that had enormous influence in shaping public attitudes was a letter (in other words an opinion piece, not a scientific article) published on 17 March 2020 in the journal Nature Medicine. Its authors were a group of virologists led by Kristian G. Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute. &ldquo;Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,&rdquo; the five virologists declared in the second paragraph of their letter.\n\nUnfortunately, this was another case of poor science, in the sense defined above. True, some older methods of cutting and pasting viral genomes retain tell-tale signs of manipulation. But newer methods, called &ldquo;no-see-um&rdquo; or &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; approaches, leave no defining marks. Nor do other methods for manipulating viruses such as serial passage, the repeated transfer of viruses from one culture of cells to another. If a virus has been manipulated, whether with a seamless method or by serial passage, there is no way of knowing that this is the case. Andersen and his colleagues were assuring their readers of something they could not know.\n\nThe discussion part of their letter begins, &ldquo;It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.&rdquo; But wait, didn&rsquo;t the lead say the virus had clearly not been manipulated? The authors&rsquo; degree of certainty seemed to slip several notches when it came to laying out their reasoning.\n\nThe reason for the slippage is clear once the technical language has been penetrated. The two reasons the authors give for supposing manipulation to be improbable are decidedly inconclusive.\n\nFirst, they say that the spike protein of SARS2 binds very well to its target, the human ACE2 receptor, but does so in a different way from that which physical calculations suggest would be the best fit. Therefore the virus must have arisen by natural selection, not manipulation.\n\nIf this argument seems hard to grasp, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so strained. The authors&rsquo; basic assumption, not spelt out, is that anyone trying to make a bat virus bind to human cells could do so in only one way. First they would calculate the strongest possible fit between the human ACE2 receptor and the spike protein with which the virus latches onto it. They would then design the spike protein accordingly (by selecting the right string of amino acid units that compose it). Since the SARS2 spike protein is not of this calculated best design, the Andersen paper says, therefore it can&rsquo;t have been manipulated.\n\nBut this ignores the way that virologists do in fact get spike proteins to bind to chosen targets, which is not by calculation but by splicing in spike protein genes from other viruses or by serial passage. With serial passage, each time the virus&rsquo;s progeny are transferred to new cell cultures or animals, the more successful are selected until one emerges that makes a really tight bind to human cells. Natural selection has done all the heavy lifting. The Andersen paper&rsquo;s speculation about designing a viral spike protein through calculation has no bearing on whether or not the virus was manipulated by one of the other two methods.\n\nThe authors&rsquo; second argument against manipulation is even more contrived. Although most living things use DNA as their hereditary material, a number of viruses use RNA, DNA&rsquo;s close chemical cousin. But RNA is difficult to manipulate, so researchers working on coronaviruses, which are RNA-based, will first convert the RNA genome to DNA. They manipulate the DNA version, whether by adding or altering genes, and then arrange for the manipulated DNA genome to be converted back into infectious RNA.\n\nOnly a certain number of these DNA backbones have been described in the scientific literature. Anyone manipulating the SARS2 virus &ldquo;would probably&rdquo; have used one of these known backbones, the Andersen group writes, and since SARS2 is not derived from any of them, therefore it was not manipulated. But the argument is conspicuously inconclusive. DNA backbones are quite easy to make, so it&rsquo;s obviously possible that SARS2 was manipulated using an unpublished DNA backbone.\n\nAnd that&rsquo;s it. These are the two arguments made by the Andersen group in support of their declaration that the SARS2 virus was clearly not manipulated. And this conclusion, grounded in nothing but two inconclusive speculations, convinced the world&rsquo;s press that SARS2 could not have escaped from a lab. A technical critique of the Andersen letter takes it down in harsher words.\n\nScience is supposedly a self-correcting community of experts who constantly check each other&rsquo;s work. So why didn&rsquo;t other virologists point out that the Andersen group&rsquo;s argument was full of absurdly large holes? Perhaps because in today&rsquo;s universities speech can be very costly. Careers can be destroyed for stepping out of line. Any virologist who challenges the community&rsquo;s declared view risks having his next grant application turned down by the panel of fellow virologists that advises the government grant distribution agency.\n\nThe Daszak and Andersen letters were really political, not scientific, statements, yet were amazingly effective. Articles in the mainstream press repeatedly stated that a consensus of experts had ruled lab escape out of the question or extremely unlikely. Their authors relied for the most part on the Daszak and Andersen letters, failing to understand the yawning gaps in their arguments. Mainstream newspapers all have science journalists on their staff, as do the major networks, and these specialist reporters are supposed to be able to question scientists and check their assertions. But the Daszak and Andersen assertions went largely unchallenged.\n\nDoubts about natural emergence. Natural emergence was the media&rsquo;s preferred theory until around February 2021 and the visit by a World Health Organization (WHO) commission to China. The commission&rsquo;s composition and access were heavily controlled by the Chinese authorities. Its members, who included the ubiquitous Daszak, kept asserting before, during, and after their visit that lab escape was extremely unlikely. But this was not quite the propaganda victory the Chinese authorities may have been hoping for. What became clear was that the Chinese had no evidence to offer the commission in support of the natural emergence theory.\n\nThis was surprising because both the SARS1 and MERS viruses had left copious traces in the environment. The intermediary host species of SARS1 was identified within four months of the epidemic&rsquo;s outbreak, and the host of MERS within nine months. Yet some 15 months after the SARS2 pandemic began, and after a presumably intensive search, Chinese researchers had failed to find either the original bat population, or the intermediate species to which SARS2 might have jumped, or any serological evidence that any Chinese population, including that of Wuhan, had ever been exposed to the virus prior to December 2019. Natural emergence remained a conjecture which, however plausible to begin with, had gained not a shred of supporting evidence in over a year.\n\nAnd as long as that remains the case, it&rsquo;s logical to pay serious attention to the alternative conjecture, that SARS2 escaped from a lab.\n\nWhy would anyone want to create a novel virus capable of causing a pandemic? Ever since virologists gained the tools for manipulating a virus&rsquo;s genes, they have argued they could get ahead of a potential pandemic by exploring how close a given animal virus might be to making the jump to humans. And that justified lab experiments in enhancing the ability of dangerous animal viruses to infect people, virologists asserted.\n\nWith this rationale, they have recreated the 1918 flu virus, shown how the almost extinct polio virus can be synthesized from its published DNA sequence, and introduced a smallpox gene into a related virus.\n\nThese enhancements of viral capabilities are known blandly as gain-of-function experiments. With coronaviruses, there was particular interest in the spike proteins, which jut out all around the spherical surface of the virus and pretty much determine which species of animal it will target. In 2000 Dutch researchers, for instance, earned the gratitude of rodents everywhere by genetically engineering the spike protein of a mouse coronavirus so that it would attack only cats.         The spike proteins on the coronavirus&rsquo;s surface determine which animal it can infect.&nbsp;Image credit: CDC.gov\n\nVirologists started studying bat coronaviruses in earnest after these turned out to be the source of both the SARS1 and MERS epidemics. In particular, researchers wanted to understand what changes needed to occur in a bat virus&rsquo;s spike proteins before it could infect people.\n\nResearchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, led by China&rsquo;s leading expert on bat viruses, Shi Zheng-li or &ldquo;Bat Lady,&rdquo; mounted frequent expeditions to the bat-infested caves of Yunnan in southern China and collected around a hundred different bat coronaviruses.\n\nShi then teamed up with Ralph S. Baric, an eminent coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina. Their work focused on enhancing the ability of bat viruses to attack humans so as to &ldquo;examine the emergence potential (that is, the potential to infect humans) of circulating bat CoVs [coronaviruses].&rdquo; In pursuit of this aim, in November 2015 they created a novel virus by taking the backbone of the SARS1 virus and replacing its spike protein with one from a bat virus (known as SHC014-CoV). This manufactured virus was able to infect the cells of the human airway, at least when tested against a lab culture of such cells.\n\nThe SHC014-CoV/SARS1 virus is known as a chimera because its genome contains genetic material from two strains of virus. If the SARS2 virus were to have been cooked up in Shi&rsquo;s lab, then its direct prototype would have been the SHC014-CoV/SARS1 chimera, the potential danger of which concerned many observers and prompted intense discussion.\n\n&ldquo;If the virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,&rdquo; said Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\nBaric and Shi referred to the obvious risks in their paper but argued they should be weighed against the benefit of foreshadowing future spillovers. Scientific review panels, they wrote, &ldquo;may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue.&rdquo; Given various restrictions being placed on gain-of function (GOF) research, matters had arrived in their view at &ldquo;a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.&rdquo;\n\nThat statement was made in 2015. From the hindsight of 2021, one can say that the value of gain-of-function studies in preventing the SARS2 epidemic was zero. The risk was catastrophic, if indeed the SARS2 virus was generated in a gain-of-function experiment.\n\nInside the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Baric had developed, and taught Shi, a general method for engineering bat coronaviruses to attack other species. The specific targets were human cells grown in cultures and humanized mice. These laboratory mice, a cheap and ethical stand-in for human subjects, are genetically engineered to carry the human version of a protein called ACE2 that studs the surface of cells that line the airways.\n\nShi returned to her lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and resumed the work she had started on genetically engineering coronaviruses to attack human cells. How can we be so sure?         A May 20, 2020, photo of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, where research on bat coronaviruses was conducted. (Photo by Kyodo News via Getty Images)\n\nBecause, by a strange twist in the story, her work was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). And grant proposals that funded her work, which are a matter of public record, specify exactly what she planned to do with the money.\n\nThe grants were assigned to the prime contractor, Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, who subcontracted them to Shi. Here are extracts from the grants for fiscal years 2018 and 2019. (&ldquo;CoV&rdquo; stands for coronavirus and &ldquo;S protein&rdquo; refers to the virus&rsquo;s spike protein.)\n\n&ldquo;Test predictions of CoV inter-species transmission. Predictive models of host range (i.e. emergence potential) will be tested experimentally using reverse genetics, pseudovirus and receptor binding assays, and virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;We will use S protein sequence data, infectious clone technology, in vitro and in vivo infection experiments and analysis of receptor binding to test the hypothesis that % divergence thresholds in S protein sequences predict spillover potential.&rdquo;\n\nWhat this means, in non-technical language, is that Shi set out to create novel coronaviruses with the highest possible infectivity for human cells. Her plan was to take genes that coded for spike proteins possessing a variety of measured affinities for human cells, ranging from high to low. She would insert these spike genes one by one into the backbone of a number of viral genomes (&ldquo;reverse genetics&rdquo; and &ldquo;infectious clone technology&rdquo;), creating a series of chimeric viruses. These chimeric viruses would then be tested for their ability to attack human cell cultures (&ldquo;in vitro&rdquo;) and humanized mice (&ldquo;in vivo&rdquo;). And this information would help predict the likelihood of &ldquo;spillover,&rdquo; the jump of a coronavirus from bats to people.\n\nThe methodical approach was designed to find the best combination of coronavirus backbone and spike protein for infecting human cells. The approach could have generated SARS2-like viruses, and indeed may have created the SARS2 virus itself with the right combination of virus backbone and spike protein.\n\nIt cannot yet be stated that Shi did or did not generate SARS2 in her lab because her records have been sealed, but it seems she was certainly on the right track to have done so. &ldquo;It is clear that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was systematically constructing novel chimeric coronaviruses and was assessing their ability to infect human cells and human-ACE2-expressing mice,&rdquo; says Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and leading expert on biosafety.\n\n&ldquo;It is also clear,&rdquo; Ebright said, &ldquo;that, depending on the constant genomic contexts chosen for analysis, this work could have produced SARS-CoV-2 or a proximal progenitor of SARS-CoV-2.&rdquo; &ldquo;Genomic context&rdquo; refers to the particular viral backbone used as the testbed for the spike protein.\n\nThe lab escape scenario for the origin of the SARS2 virus, as should by now be evident, is not mere hand-waving in the direction of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is a detailed proposal, based on the specific project being funded there by the NIAID.\n\nEven if the grant required the work plan described above, how can we be sure that the plan was in fact carried out? For that we can rely on the word of Daszak, who has been much protesting for the last 15 months that lab escape was a ludicrous conspiracy theory invented by China-bashers.\n\nOn December 9, 2019, before the outbreak of the pandemic became generally known, Daszak gave an interview in which he talked in glowing terms of how researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been reprogramming the spike protein and generating chimeric coronaviruses capable of infecting humanized mice.\n\n&ldquo;And we have now found, you know, after 6 or 7 years of doing this, over 100 new SARS-related coronaviruses, very close to SARS,&rdquo; Daszak says around minute 28 of the interview. &ldquo;Some of them get into human cells in the lab, some of them can cause SARS disease in humanized mice models and are untreatable with therapeutic monoclonals and you can&rsquo;t vaccinate against them with a vaccine. So, these are a clear and present danger&hellip;. RELATED:RELATED:&nbsp; Intelligence community investigation unable to reach consensus on the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n&ldquo;Interviewer: You say these are diverse coronaviruses and you can&rsquo;t vaccinate against them, and no anti-virals &mdash; so what do we do?\n\n&ldquo;Daszak: Well I think&hellip;coronaviruses &mdash; you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily. Spike protein drives a lot of what happen with coronavirus, in zoonotic risk. So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein, and we work a lot with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this. Insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in the lab. So you can get more predictive when you find a sequence. You&rsquo;ve got this diversity. Now the logical progression for vaccines is, if you are going to develop a vaccine for SARS, people are going to use pandemic SARS, but let&rsquo;s insert some of these other things and get a better vaccine.&rdquo; The insertions he referred to perhaps included an element called the furin cleavage site, discussed below, which greatly increases viral infectivity for human cells.\n\nIn disjointed style, Daszak is referring to the fact that once you have generated a novel coronavirus that can attack human cells, you can take the spike protein and make it the basis for a vaccine.\n\nOne can only imagine Daszak&rsquo;s reaction when he heard of the outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan a few days later. He would have known better than anyone the Wuhan Institute&rsquo;s goal of making bat coronaviruses infectious to humans, as well as the weaknesses in the institute&rsquo;s defense against their own researchers becoming infected.\n\nBut instead of providing public health authorities with the plentiful information at his disposal, he immediately launched a public relations campaign to persuade the world that the epidemic couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been caused by one of the institute&rsquo;s souped-up viruses. &ldquo;The idea that this virus escaped from a lab is just pure baloney. It&rsquo;s simply not true,&rdquo; he declared in an April 2020 interview.\n\nThe safety arrangements at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Daszak was possibly unaware of, or perhaps he knew all too well, the long history of viruses escaping from even the best run laboratories. The smallpox virus escaped three times from labs in England in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, causing 80 cases and 3 deaths. Dangerous viruses have leaked out of labs almost every year since. Coming to more recent times, the SARS1 virus has proved a true escape artist, leaking from laboratories in Singapore, Taiwan, and no less than four times from the Chinese National Institute of Virology in Beijing.\n\nOne reason for SARS1 being so hard to handle is that there were no vaccines available to protect laboratory workers. As Daszak mentioned in the December 19 interview quoted above, the Wuhan researchers too had been unable to develop vaccines against the coronaviruses they had designed to infect human cells. They would have been as defenseless against the SARS2 virus, if it were generated in their lab, as their Beijing colleagues were against SARS1.\n\nA second reason for the severe danger of novel coronaviruses has to do with the required levels of lab safety. There are four degrees of safety, designated BSL1 to BSL4, with BSL4 being the most restrictive and designed for deadly pathogens like the Ebola virus.\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology had a new BSL4 lab, but its state of readiness considerably alarmed the State Department inspectors who visited it from the Beijing embassy in 2018. &ldquo;The new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,&rdquo; the inspectors wrote in a cable of January 19, 2018.\n\nThe real problem, however, was not the unsafe state of the Wuhan BSL4 lab but the fact that virologists worldwide don&rsquo;t like working in BSL4 conditions. You have to wear a space suit, do operations in closed cabinets, and accept that everything will take twice as long. So the rules assigning each kind of virus to a given safety level were laxer than some might think was prudent.\n\nBefore 2020, the rules followed by virologists in China and elsewhere required that experiments with the SARS1 and MERS viruses be conducted in BSL3 conditions. But all other bat coronaviruses could be studied in BSL2, the next level down. BSL2 requires taking fairly minimal safety precautions, such as wearing lab coats and gloves, not sucking up liquids in a pipette, and putting up biohazard warning signs. Yet a gain-of-function experiment conducted in BSL2 might produce an agent more infectious than either SARS1 or MERS. And if it did, then lab workers would stand a high chance of infection, especially if unvaccinated.\n\nMuch of Shi&rsquo;s work on gain-of-function in coronaviruses was performed at the BSL2 safety level, as is stated in her publications and other documents. She has said in an interview with Science magazine that &ldquo;[t]he coronavirus research in our laboratory is conducted in BSL-2 or BSL-3 laboratories.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;It is clear that some or all of this work was being performed using a biosafety standard &mdash; biosafety level 2, the biosafety level of a standard US dentist&rsquo;s office &mdash; that would pose an unacceptably high risk of infection of laboratory staff upon contact with a virus having the transmission properties of SARS-CoV-2,&rdquo; Ebright says.\n\n&ldquo;It also is clear,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;that this work never should have been funded and never should have been performed.&rdquo;\n\nThis is a view he holds regardless of whether or not the SARS2 virus ever saw the inside of a lab.\n\nConcern about safety conditions at the Wuhan lab was not, it seems, misplaced. According to a fact sheet issued by the State Department on January 15, 2021, &ldquo;The U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.&rdquo;\n\nDavid Asher, a fellow of the Hudson Institute and former consultant to the State Department, provided more detail about the incident at a seminar. Knowledge of the incident came from a mix of public information and &ldquo;some high end information collected by our intelligence community,&rdquo; he said. Three people working at a BSL3 lab at the institute fell sick within a week of each other with severe symptoms that required hospitalization. This was &ldquo;the first known cluster that we&rsquo;re aware of, of victims of what we believe to be COVID-19.&rdquo; Influenza could not completely be ruled out but seemed unlikely in the circumstances, he said.\n\nComparing the rival scenarios of SARS2 origin. The evidence above adds up to a serious case that the SARS2 virus could have been created in a lab, from which it then escaped. But the case, however substantial, falls short of proof. Proof would consist of evidence from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or related labs in Wuhan, that SARS2 or a predecessor virus was under development there. For lack of access to such records, another approach is to take certain salient facts about the SARS2 virus and ask how well each is explained by the two rival scenarios of origin, those of natural emergence and lab escape. Here are four tests of the two hypotheses. A couple have some technical detail, but these are among the most persuasive for those who may care to follow the argument.\n\n1) The place of origin. Start with geography. The two closest known relatives of the SARS2 virus were collected from bats living in caves in Yunnan, a province of southern China. If the SARS2 virus had first infected people living around the Yunnan caves, that would strongly support the idea that the virus had spilled over to people naturally. But this isn&rsquo;t what happened. The pandemic broke out 1,500 kilometers away, in Wuhan.\n\nBeta-coronaviruses, the family of bat viruses to which SARS2 belongs, infect the horseshoe bat Rhinolophus affinis, which ranges across southern China. The bats&rsquo; range is 50 kilometers, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that any made it to Wuhan. In any case, the first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic probably occurred in September, when temperatures in Hubei province are already cold enough to send bats into hibernation.\n\nWhat if the bat viruses infected some intermediate host first? You would need a longstanding population of bats in frequent proximity with an intermediate host, which in turn must often cross paths with people. All these exchanges of virus must take place somewhere outside Wuhan, a busy metropolis which so far as is known is not a natural habitat of Rhinolophus bat colonies. The infected person (or animal) carrying this highly transmissible virus must have traveled to Wuhan without infecting anyone else. No one in his or her family got sick. If the person jumped on a train to Wuhan, no fellow passengers fell ill.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a stretch, in other words, to get the pandemic to break out naturally outside Wuhan and then, without leaving any trace, to make its first appearance there.\n\nFor the lab escape scenario, a Wuhan origin for the virus is a no-brainer. Wuhan is home to China&rsquo;s leading center of coronavirus research where, as noted above, researchers were genetically engineering bat coronaviruses to attack human cells. They were doing so under the minimal safety conditions of a BSL2 lab. If a virus with the unexpected infectiousness of SARS2 had been generated there, its escape would be no surprise.\n\n2) Natural history and evolution. The initial location of the pandemic is a small part of a larger problem, that of its natural history. Viruses don&rsquo;t just make one time jumps from one species to another. The coronavirus spike protein, adapted to attack bat cells, needs repeated jumps to another species, most of which fail, before it gains a lucky mutation. Mutation &mdash; a change in one of its RNA units &mdash; causes a different amino acid unit to be incorporated into its spike protein and makes the spike protein better able to attack the cells of some other species.\n\nThrough several more such mutation-driven adjustments, the virus adapts to its new host, say some animal with which bats are in frequent contact. The whole process then resumes as the virus moves from this intermediate host to people.\n\nIn the case of SARS1, researchers have documented the successive changes in its spike protein as the virus evolved step by step into a dangerous pathogen. After it had gotten from bats into civets, there were six further changes in its spike protein before it became a mild pathogen in people. After a further 14 changes, the virus was much better adapted to humans, and with a further four, the epidemic took off.\n\nBut when you look for the fingerprints of a similar transition in SARS2, a strange surprise awaits. The virus has changed hardly at all, at least until recently. From its very first appearance, it was well adapted to human cells. Researchers led by Alina Chan of the Broad Institute compared SARS2 with late stage SARS1, which by then was well adapted to human cells, and found that the two viruses were similarly well adapted. &ldquo;By the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV,&rdquo; they wrote.\n\nEven those who think lab origin unlikely agree that SARS2 genomes are remarkably uniform. Baric writes that &ldquo;early strains identified in Wuhan, China, showed limited genetic diversity, which suggests that the virus may have been introduced from a single source.&rdquo;\n\nA single source would of course be compatible with lab escape, less so with the massive variation and selection which is evolution&rsquo;s hallmark way of doing business.\n\nThe uniform structure of SARS2 genomes gives no hint of any passage through an intermediate animal host, and no such host has been identified in nature.\n\nProponents of natural emergence suggest that SARS2 incubated in a yet-to-be found human population before gaining its special properties. Or that it jumped to a host animal outside China.\n\nAll these conjectures are possible, but strained. Proponents of a lab leak have a simpler explanation. SARS2 was adapted to human cells from the start because it was grown in humanized mice or in lab cultures of human cells, just as described in Daszak&rsquo;s grant proposal. Its genome shows little diversity because the hallmark of lab cultures is uniformity.\n\nProponents of laboratory escape joke that of course the SARS2 virus infected an intermediary host species before spreading to people, and that they have identified it &mdash; a humanized mouse from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n3) The furin cleavage site. The furin cleavage site is a minute part of the virus&rsquo;s anatomy but one that exerts great influence on its infectivity. It sits in the middle of the SARS2 spike protein. It also lies at the heart of the puzzle of where the virus came from.\n\nThe spike protein has two sub-units with different roles. The first, called S1, recognizes the virus&rsquo;s target, a protein called angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (or ACE2) which studs the surface of cells lining the human airways. The second, S2, helps the virus, once anchored to the cell, to fuse with the cell&rsquo;s membrane. After the virus&rsquo;s outer membrane has coalesced with that of the stricken cell, the viral genome is injected into the cell, hijacks its protein-making machinery and forces it to generate new viruses.\n\nBut this invasion cannot begin until the S1 and S2 subunits have been cut apart. And there, right at the S1/S2 junction, is the furin cleavage site that ensures the spike protein will be cleaved in exactly the right place.\n\nThe virus, a model of economic design, does not carry its own cleaver. It relies on the cell to do the cleaving for it. Human cells have a protein cutting tool on their surface known as furin. Furin will cut any protein chain that carries its signature target cutting site. This is the sequence of amino acid units proline-arginine-arginine-alanine, or PRRA in the code that refers to each amino acid by a letter of the alphabet. PRRA is the amino acid sequence at the core of SARS2&rsquo;s furin cleavage site.\n\nViruses have all kinds of clever tricks, so why does the furin cleavage site stand out? Because of all known SARS-related beta-coronaviruses, only SARS2 possesses a furin cleavage site. All the other viruses have their S2 unit cleaved at a different site and by a different mechanism.\n\nHow then did SARS2 acquire its furin cleavage site? Either the site evolved naturally, or it was inserted by researchers at the S1/S2 junction in a gain-of-function experiment.\n\nConsider natural origin first. Two ways viruses evolve are by mutation and by recombination. Mutation is the process of random change in DNA (or RNA for coronaviruses) that usually results in one amino acid in a protein chain being switched for another. Many of these changes harm the virus but natural selection retains the few that do something useful. Mutation is the process by which the SARS1 spike protein gradually switched its preferred target cells from those of bats to civets, and then to humans.\n\nMutation seems a less likely way for SARS2&rsquo;s furin cleavage site to be generated, even though it can&rsquo;t completely be ruled out. The site&rsquo;s four amino acid units are all together, and all at just the right place in the S1/S2 junction. Mutation is a random process triggered by copying errors (when new viral genomes are being generated) or by chemical decay of genomic units. So it typically affects single amino acids at different spots in a protein chain. A string of amino acids like that of the furin cleavage site is much more likely to be acquired all together through a quite different process known as recombination.\n\nRecombination is an inadvertent swapping of genomic material that occurs when two viruses happen to invade the same cell, and their progeny are assembled with bits and pieces of RNA belonging to the other. Beta-coronaviruses will only combine with other beta-coronaviruses but can acquire, by recombination, almost any genetic element present in the collective genomic pool. What they cannot acquire is an element the pool does not possess. And no known SARS-related beta-coronavirus, the class to which SARS2 belongs, possesses a furin cleavage site.\n\nProponents of natural emergence say SARS2 could have picked up the site from some as yet unknown beta-coronavirus. But bat SARS-related beta-coronaviruses evidently don&rsquo;t need a furin cleavage site to infect bat cells, so there&rsquo;s no great likelihood that any in fact possesses one, and indeed none has been found so far.\n\nThe proponents&rsquo; next argument is that SARS2 acquired its furin cleavage site from people. A predecessor of SARS2 could have been circulating in the human population for months or years until at some point it acquired a furin cleavage site from human cells. It would then have been ready to break out as a pandemic.\n\nIf this is what happened, there should be traces in hospital surveillance records of the people infected by the slowly evolving virus. But none has so far come to light. According to the WHO report on the origins of the virus, the sentinel hospitals in Hubei province, home of Wuhan, routinely monitor influenza-like illnesses and &ldquo;no evidence to suggest substantial SARSCoV-2 transmission in the months preceding the outbreak in December was observed.&rdquo;\n\nSo it&rsquo;s hard to explain how the SARS2 virus picked up its furin cleavage site naturally, whether by mutation or recombination.\n\nThat leaves a gain-of-function experiment. For those who think SARS2 may have escaped from a lab, explaining the furin cleavage site is no problem at all. &ldquo;Since 1992 the virology community has known that the one sure way to make a virus deadlier is to give it a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction in the laboratory,&rdquo; writes Steven Quay, a biotech entrepreneur interested in the origins of SARS2. &ldquo;At least 11 gain-of-function experiments, adding a furin site to make a virus more infective, are published in the open literature, including [by] Dr. Zhengli Shi, head of coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.&rdquo;\n\n4) A question of codons. There&rsquo;s another aspect of the furin cleavage site that narrows the path for a natural emergence origin even further.\n\nAs everyone knows (or may at least recall from high school), the genetic code uses three units of DNA to specify each amino acid unit of a protein chain. When read in groups of 3, the 4 different kinds of DNA unit can specify 4 x 4 x 4 or 64 different triplets, or codons as they are called. Since there are only 20 kinds of amino acid, there are more than enough codons to go around, allowing some amino acids to be specified by more than one codon. The amino acid arginine, for instance, can be designated by any of the six codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA or AGG, where A, U, G and C stand for the four different kinds of unit in RNA.\n\nHere&rsquo;s where it gets interesting. Different organisms have different codon preferences. Human cells like to designate arginine with the codons CGT, CGC or CGG. But CGG is coronavirus&rsquo;s least popular codon for arginine. Keep that in mind when looking at how the amino acids in the furin cleavage site are encoded in the SARS2 genome.\n\nNow the functional reason why SARS2 has a furin cleavage site, and its cousin viruses don&rsquo;t, can be seen by lining up (in a computer) the string of nearly 30,000 nucleotides in its genome with those of its cousin coronaviruses, of which the closest so far known is one called RaTG13. Compared with RaTG13, SARS2 has a 12-nucleotide insert right at the S1/S2 junction. The insert is the sequence T-CCT-CGG-CGG-GC. The CCT codes for proline, the two CGG&rsquo;s for two arginines, and the GC is the beginning of a GCA codon that codes for alanine.\n\nThere are several curious features about this insert but the oddest is that of the two side-by-side CGG codons. Only 5 percent of SARS2&rsquo;s arginine codons are CGG, and the double codon CGG-CGG has not been found in any other beta-coronavirus. So how did SARS2 acquire a pair of arginine codons that are favored by human cells but not by coronaviruses?\n\nProponents of natural emergence have an up-hill task to explain all the features of SARS2&rsquo;s furin cleavage site. They have to postulate a recombination event at a site on the virus&rsquo;s genome where recombinations are rare, and the insertion of a 12-nucleotide sequence with a double arginine codon unknown in the beta-coronavirus repertoire, at the only site in the genome that would significantly expand the virus&rsquo;s infectivity.\n\n&ldquo;Yes, but your wording makes this sound unlikely &mdash; viruses are specialists at unusual events,&rdquo; is the riposte of David L. Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow who regards lab escape as a conspiracy theory. &ldquo;Recombination is naturally very, very frequent in these viruses, there are recombination breakpoints in the spike protein and these codons appear unusual exactly because we&rsquo;ve not sampled enough.&rdquo;\n\nRobertson is correct that evolution is always producing results that may seem unlikely but in fact are not. Viruses can generate untold numbers of variants but we see only the one-in-a-billion that natural selection picks for survival. But this argument could be pushed too far. For instance, any result of a gain-of-function experiment could be explained as one that evolution would have arrived at in time. And the numbers game can be played the other way. For the furin cleavage site to arise naturally in SARS2, a chain of events has to happen, each of which is quite unlikely for the reasons given above. A long chain with several improbable steps is unlikely to ever be completed. RELATED:RELATED:&nbsp; The origin of COVID-19: Evidence piles up, but the jury’s still out\n\nFor the lab escape scenario, the double CGG codon is no surprise. The human-preferred codon is routinely used in labs. So anyone who wanted to insert a furin cleavage site into the virus&rsquo;s genome would synthesize the PRRA-making sequence in the lab and would be likely to use CGG codons to do so.   &ldquo;When I first saw the furin cleavage site in the viral sequence, with its arginine codons, I said to my wife it was the smoking gun for the origin of the virus,&rdquo; said David Baltimore, an eminent virologist and former president of CalTech. &ldquo;These features make a powerful challenge to the idea of a natural origin for SARS2,&rdquo; he said. [1]  A third scenario of origin. There&rsquo;s a variation on the natural emergence scenario that&rsquo;s worth considering. This is the idea that SARS2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without going through an intermediate host as SARS1 and MERS did. A leading advocate is the virologist David Robertson who notes that SARS2 can attack several other species besides humans. He believes the virus  evolved a generalist capability while still in bats. Because the bats it infects are widely distributed in southern and central China, the virus had ample opportunity to jump to people, even though it seems to have done so on only one known occasion. Robertson&rsquo;s thesis explains why no one has so far found a trace of SARS2 in any intermediate host or in human populations surveilled before December 2019. It would also explain the puzzling fact that SARS2 has not changed since it first appeared in humans &mdash; it didn&rsquo;t need to because it could already attack human cells efficiently.\n\nOne problem with this idea, though, is that if SARS2 jumped from bats to people in a single leap and hasn&rsquo;t changed much since, it should still be good at infecting bats. And it seems it isn&rsquo;t.\n\n&ldquo;Tested bat species are poorly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and they are therefore unlikely to be the direct source for human infection,&rdquo; write a scientific group skeptical of natural emergence.\n\nStill, Robertson may be onto something. The bat coronaviruses of the Yunnan caves can infect people directly. In April 2012 six miners clearing bat guano from the Mojiang mine contracted severe pneumonia with COVID-19-like symptoms and three eventually died. A virus isolated from the Mojiang mine, called RaTG13, is still the closest known relative of SARS2. Much mystery surrounds the origin, reporting and strangely low affinity of RaTG13 for bat cells, as well as the nature of 8 similar viruses that Shi reports she collected at the same time but has not yet published despite their great relevance to the ancestry of SARS2. But all that is a story for another time. The point here is that bat viruses can infect people directly, though only in special conditions.\n\nSo who else, besides miners excavating bat guano, comes into particularly close contact with bat coronaviruses? Well, coronavirus researchers do. Shi says she and her group collected more than 1,300 bat samples during some eight visits to the Mojiang cave between 2012 and 2015, and there were doubtless many expeditions to other Yunnan caves.\n\nImagine the researchers making frequent trips from Wuhan to Yunnan and back, stirring up bat guano in dark caves and mines, and now you begin to see a possible missing link between the two places. Researchers could have gotten infected during their collecting trips, or while working with the new viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus that escaped from the lab would have been a natural virus, not one cooked up by gain of function.\n\nThe direct-from-bats thesis is a chimera between the natural emergence and lab escape scenarios. It&rsquo;s a possibility that can&rsquo;t be dismissed. But against it are the facts that 1) both SARS2 and RaTG13 seem to have only feeble affinity for bat cells, so one can&rsquo;t be fully confident that either ever saw the inside of a bat; and 2) the theory is no better than the natural emergence scenario at explaining how SARS2 gained its furin cleavage site, or why the furin cleavage site is determined by human-preferred arginine codons instead of by the bat-preferred codons.\n\nWhere we are so far. Neither the natural emergence nor the lab escape hypothesis can yet be ruled out. There is still no direct evidence for either. So no definitive conclusion can be reached.\n\nThat said, the available evidence leans more strongly in one direction than the other. Readers will form their own opinion. But it seems to me that proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about SARS2 considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence.\n\nIt&rsquo;s documented that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were doing gain-of-function experiments designed to make coronaviruses infect human cells and humanized mice. This is exactly the kind of experiment from which a SARS2-like virus could have emerged. The researchers were not vaccinated against the viruses under study, and they were working in the minimal safety conditions of a BSL2 laboratory. So escape of a virus would not be at all surprising. In all of China, the pandemic broke out on the doorstep of the Wuhan institute. The virus was already well adapted to humans, as expected for a virus grown in humanized mice. It possessed an unusual enhancement, a furin cleavage site, which is not possessed by any other known SARS-related beta-coronavirus, and this site included a double arginine codon also unknown among beta-coronaviruses. What more evidence could you want, aside from the presently unobtainable lab records documenting SARS2&rsquo;s creation?\n\nProponents of natural emergence have a rather harder story to tell. The plausibility of their case rests on a single surmise, the expected parallel between the emergence of SARS2 and that of SARS1 and MERS. But none of the evidence expected in support of such a parallel history has yet emerged. No one has found the bat population that was the source of SARS2, if indeed it ever infected bats. No intermediate host has presented itself, despite an intensive search by Chinese authorities that included the testing of 80,000 animals. There is no evidence of the virus making multiple independent jumps from its intermediate host to people, as both the SARS1 and MERS viruses did. There is no evidence from hospital surveillance records of the epidemic gathering strength in the population as the virus evolved. There is no explanation of why a natural epidemic should break out in Wuhan and nowhere else. There is no good explanation of how the virus acquired its furin cleavage site, which no other SARS-related beta-coronavirus possesses, nor why the site is composed of human-preferred codons. The natural emergence theory battles a bristling array of implausibilities.\n\nThe records of the Wuhan Institute of Virology certainly hold much relevant information. But Chinese authorities seem unlikely to release them given the substantial chance that they incriminate the regime in the creation of the pandemic. Absent the efforts of some courageous Chinese whistle-blower, we may already have at hand just about all of the relevant information we are likely to get for a while.\n\nSo it&rsquo;s worth trying to assess responsibility for the pandemic, at least in a provisional way, because the paramount goal remains to prevent another one. Even those who aren&rsquo;t persuaded that lab escape is the more likely origin of the SARS2 virus may see reason for concern about the present state of regulation governing gain-of-function research. There are two obvious levels of responsibility: the first, for allowing virologists to perform gain-of-function experiments, offering minimal gain and vast risk; the second, if indeed SARS2 was generated in a lab, for allowing the virus to escape and unleash a world-wide pandemic. Here are the players who seem most likely to deserve blame.  Chinese virologists. First and foremost, Chinese virologists are to blame for performing gain-of-function experiments in mostly BSL2-level safety conditions which were far too lax to contain a virus of unexpected infectiousness like SARS2. If the virus did indeed escape from their lab, they deserve the world&rsquo;s censure for a foreseeable accident that has already caused the deaths of three&nbsp; million people. True, Shi was trained by French virologists, worked closely with American virologists and was following international rules for the containment of coronaviruses. But she could and should have made her own assessment of the risks she was running. She and her colleagues bear the responsibility for their actions.\n\nI have been using the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a shorthand for all virological activities in Wuhan. It&rsquo;s possible that SARS2 was generated in some other Wuhan lab, perhaps in an attempt to make a vaccine that worked against all coronaviruses. But until the role of other Chinese virologists is clarified, Shi is the public face of Chinese work on coronaviruses, and provisionally she and her colleagues will stand first in line for opprobrium.\n\n2. Chinese authorities. China&rsquo;s central authorities did not generate SARS2, but they sure did their utmost to conceal the nature of the tragedy and China&rsquo;s responsibility for it. They suppressed all records at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and closed down its virus databases. They released a trickle of information, much of which may have been outright false or designed to misdirect and mislead. They did their best to manipulate the WHO&rsquo;s inquiry into the virus&rsquo;s origins, and led the commission&rsquo;s members on a fruitless run-around. So far they have proved far more interested in deflecting blame than in taking the steps necessary to prevent a second pandemic.\n\n3. The worldwide community of virologists. Virologists around the world are a loose-knit professional community. They write articles in the same journals. They attend the same conferences. They have common interests in seeking funds from governments and in not being overburdened with safety regulations.\n\nVirologists knew better than anyone the dangers of gain-of-function research. But the power to create new viruses, and the research funding obtainable by doing so, was too tempting. They pushed ahead with gain-of-function experiments. They lobbied against the moratorium imposed on Federal funding for gain-of-function research in 2014, and it was raised in 2017.\n\nThe benefits of the research in preventing future epidemics have so far been nil, the risks vast. If research on the SARS1 and MERS viruses could only be done at the BSL3 safety level, it was surely illogical to allow any work with novel coronaviruses at the lesser level of BSL2. Whether or not SARS2 escaped from a lab, virologists around the world have been playing with fire.\n\nTheir behavior has long alarmed other biologists. In 2014 scientists calling themselves the Cambridge Working Group urged caution on creating new viruses. In prescient words, they specified the risk of creating a SARS2-like virus. &ldquo;Accident risks with newly created &lsquo;potential pandemic pathogens&rsquo; raise grave new concerns,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Laboratory creation of highly transmissible, novel strains of dangerous viruses, especially but not limited to influenza, poses substantially increased risks. An accidental infection in such a setting could trigger outbreaks that would be difficult or impossible to control.&rdquo;\n\nWhen molecular biologists discovered a technique for moving genes from one organism to another, they held a public conference at Asilomar in 1975 to discuss the possible risks. Despite much internal opposition, they drew up a list of stringent safety measures that could be relaxed in future &mdash; and duly were &mdash; when the possible hazards had been better assessed.\n\nWhen the CRISPR technique for editing genes was invented, biologists convened a joint report by the US, UK and Chinese national academies of science to urge restraint on making heritable changes to the human genome. Biologists who invented gene drives have also been open about the dangers of their work and have sought to involve the public.\n\nYou might think the SARS2 pandemic would spur virologists to re-evaluate the benefits of gain-of-function research, even to engage the public in their deliberations. But no. Many virologists deride lab escape as a conspiracy theory, and others say nothing. They have barricaded themselves behind a Chinese wall of silence which so far is working well to allay, or at least postpone, journalists&rsquo; curiosity and the public&rsquo;s wrath. Professions that cannot regulate themselves deserve to get regulated by others, and this would seem to be the future that virologists are choosing for themselves.\n\n4. The US role in funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology.[2] From June 2014 to May 2019, Daszak&rsquo;s EcoHealth Alliance had a grant&nbsp;from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, to do gain-of-function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Whether or not SARS2 is the product of that research, it seems a questionable policy to farm out high-risk research to foreign labs using minimal safety precautions. And if the SARS2 virus did indeed escape from the Wuhan institute, then the NIH will find itself in the terrible position of having funded a disastrous experiment that led to the death of more than 3 million worldwide, including more than half a million of its own citizens.\n\nThe responsibility of the NIAID and NIH is even more acute because for the first three years of the grant to EcoHealth Alliance there was a moratorium on funding gain-of-function research.&nbsp; When the moratorium expired in 2017, it didn&rsquo;t just vanish but was replaced by a reporting system, the Potential Pandemic Pathogens Control and Oversight (P3CO) Framework, which required agencies to report for review any dangerous gain-of-function work they wished to fund.\n\nThe moratorium, referred to officially as a &ldquo;pause,&rdquo; specifically barred funding any gain-of-function research that increased the pathogenicity of the flu, MERS or SARS viruses.&nbsp; It defined gain-of-function very simply and broadly as &ldquo;research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.&rdquo;\n\nBut then a&nbsp;footnote on p.2 of the moratorium document states that &ldquo;[a]n exception from the research pause may be obtained if the head of the USG funding agency determines that the research is urgently necessary to protect the public health or national security.&rdquo;\n\nThis seemed to mean that either the director of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, or the director of the NIH, Francis Collins, or maybe both, would have invoked the exemption &nbsp;in order to keep the money flowing to Shi&rsquo;s gain-of-function research, and later to avoid notifying the federal reporting system of her research.\n\n&ldquo;Unfortunately, the NIAID Director and the NIH Director exploited this loophole to issue exemptions to projects subject to the Pause &ndash;preposterously asserting the exempted research was &lsquo;urgently necessary to protect public health or national security&rsquo;&mdash;thereby nullifying the Pause,&rdquo; Dr. Richard Ebright said in an interview&nbsp;with Independent Science News.\n\nBut it&rsquo;s not so clear that the NIH thought it necessary to invoke any loopholes. Fauci told a Senate hearing on May 11 that &ldquo;the NIH and NIAID categorically has not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.&rdquo;\n\nThis was a surprising statement in view of all the evidence about Shi&rsquo;s experiments with enhancing coronaviruses and the language of the moratorium statute defining gain-of-function as &ldquo;any research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.&rdquo;\n\nThe explanation may be one of definition. Daszak&rsquo;s EcoHealth Alliance, for one, believes that the term gain-of-function applies only to enhancements of viruses that infect humans, not to animal viruses. &ldquo;So gain-of-function research refers specifically to the manipulation of human viruses so as to be either more easily transmissible or to cause worse infection or be easier to spread,&rdquo; an Alliance official told The Dispatch Fact Check.\n\nIf the NIH shares the EcoHealth Alliance view that &ldquo;gain of function&rdquo; applies only to human viruses, that would explain why Fauci could assure the Senate it had never funded such research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But the legal basis of such a definition is unclear, and it differs from that of the moratorium language which was presumably applicable.\n\nDefinitions aside, the bottom line is that the National Institutes of Health was supporting research of a kind that could have generated the SARS2 virus, in an unsupervised foreign lab that was doing work in BSL2 biosafety conditions.\n\nIn conclusion. If the case that SARS2 originated in a lab is so substantial, why isn&rsquo;t this more widely known? As may now be obvious, there are many people who have reason not to talk about it. The list is led, of course, by the Chinese authorities. But virologists in the United States and Europe have no great interest in igniting a public debate about the gain-of-function experiments that their community has been pursuing for years.\n\nNor have other scientists stepped forward to raise the issue. Government research funds are distributed on the advice of committees of scientific experts drawn from universities. Anyone who rocks the boat by raising awkward political issues runs the risk that their grant will not be renewed and their research career will be ended. Maybe good behavior is rewarded with the many perks that slosh around the distribution system. And if you thought that Andersen and Daszak might have blotted their reputation for scientific objectivity after their partisan attacks on the lab escape scenario, look at the second and third names on this list of recipients of an $82 million grant announced by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in August 2020.\n\nThe US government shares a strange common interest with the Chinese authorities: Neither is keen on drawing attention to the fact that Shi&rsquo;s coronavirus work was funded by the US National Institutes of Health. One can imagine the behind-the-scenes conversation in which the Chinese government says, &ldquo;If this research was so dangerous, why did you fund it, and on our territory too?&rdquo; To which the US side might reply, &ldquo;Looks like it was you who let it escape. But do we really need to have this discussion in public?&rdquo;\n\nFauci is a longtime public servant who served with integrity under President Trump and has resumed leadership in the Biden Administration in handling the COVID-19 epidemic. Congress, no doubt understandably, may have little appetite for hauling him over the coals for the apparent lapse of judgment in funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan.\n\nTo these serried walls of silence must be added that of the mainstream media. To my knowledge, no major newspaper or television network has yet provided readers with an in-depth news story of the lab escape scenario, such as the one you have just read, although some have run brief editorials or opinion pieces. One might think that any plausible origin of a virus that has killed three million people would merit a serious investigation. Or that the wisdom of continuing gain-of-function research, regardless of the virus&rsquo;s origin, would be worth some probing. Or that the funding of gain-of-function research by the NIH and NIAID during a moratorium on such funding would bear investigation. What accounts for the media&rsquo;s apparent lack of curiosity?\n\nThe virologists&rsquo; omert&agrave; is one reason. Science reporters, unlike political reporters, have little innate skepticism of their sources&rsquo; motives; most see their role largely as purveying the wisdom of scientists to the unwashed masses. So when their sources won&rsquo;t help, these journalists are at a loss.\n\nAnother reason, perhaps, is the migration of much of the media toward the left of the political spectrum. Because President Trump said the virus had escaped from a Wuhan lab, editors gave the idea little credence. They joined the virologists in regarding lab escape as a dismissible conspiracy theory. During the Trump administration, they had no trouble in rejecting the position of the intelligence services that lab escape could not be ruled out. But when Avril Haines, President Biden&rsquo;s director of national intelligence, said the same thing, she too was largely ignored. This is not to argue that editors should have endorsed the lab escape scenario, merely that they should have explored the possibility fully and fairly.\n\nPeople round the world who have been pretty much confined to their homes for the last year might like a better answer than their media are giving them. Perhaps one will emerge in time. After all, the more months pass without the natural emergence theory gaining a shred of supporting evidence, the less plausible it may seem. Perhaps the international community of virologists will come to be seen as a false and self-interested guide. The common sense perception that a pandemic breaking out in Wuhan might have something to do with a Wuhan lab cooking up novel viruses of maximal danger in unsafe conditions could eventually displace the ideological insistence that whatever Trump said can&rsquo;t be true.\n\nAnd then let the reckoning begin.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] This quotation was added to the article after initial publication.\n\n[2] Section revised May 18, 2021\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe first person to take a serious look at the origins of the SARS2 virus was Yuri Deigin, a biotech entrepreneur in Russia and Canada. In a long and brilliant essay, he dissected the molecular biology of the SARS2 virus and raised, without endorsing, the possibility that it had been manipulated. The essay, published on April 22, 2020, provided a roadmap for anyone seeking to understand the virus&rsquo;s origins. Deigin packed so much information and analysis into his essay that some have doubted it could be the work of a single individual and suggested some intelligence agency must have authored it. But the essay is written with greater lightness and humor than I suspect are ever found in CIA or KGB reports, and I see no reason to doubt that Deigin is its very capable sole author.\n\nIn Deigin&rsquo;s wake have followed several other skeptics of the virologists&rsquo; orthodoxy. Nikolai Petrovsky calculated how tightly the SARS2 virus binds to the ACE2 receptors of various species and found to his surprise that it seemed optimized for the human receptor, leading him to infer the virus might have been generated in a laboratory. Alina Chan published a paper showing that SARS2 from its first appearance was very well adapted to human cells.\n\nOne of the very few establishment scientists to have questioned the virologists&rsquo; absolute rejection of lab escape is Richard Ebright, who has long warned against the dangers of gain-of-function research. Another is David A. Relman of Stanford University. &ldquo;Even though strong opinions abound, none of these scenarios can be confidently ruled in or ruled out with currently available facts,&rdquo; he wrote. Kudos too to Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who told CNN on March 26, 2021 that the &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; cause of the epidemic was &ldquo;from a laboratory,&rdquo; because he doubted that a bat virus could become an extreme human pathogen overnight, without taking time to evolve, as seemed to be the case with SARS2.\n\nSteven Quay, a physician-researcher, has applied statistical and bioinformatic tools to ingenious explorations of the virus&rsquo;s origin, showing for instance how the hospitals receiving the early patients are clustered along the Wuhan №2 subway line which connects the Institute of Virology at one end with the international airport at the other, the perfect conveyor belt for distributing the virus from lab to globe.\n\nIn June 2020 Milton Leitenberg published an early survey of the evidence favoring lab escape from gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nMany others have contributed significant pieces of the puzzle. &ldquo;Truth is the daughter,&rdquo; said Francis Bacon, &ldquo;not of authority but time.&rdquo; The efforts of people such as those named above are what makes it so.  	   	 		\n\n\r\n   	   	 		  	  	  			As the coronavirus crisis shows, we need science now more than ever.			  				\n\nThe Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

major newspaper or television network has yet provided readers with an in-depth news story of the lab escape scenario,&#8221; seems untrue given that CBS&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; ran a segment on the lab hypothesis. Have you seen the segment, and if so, what are your opinions?                                            -102                                          Reply                                                                                             Gary                    5 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Robert Schaefer              60 minutes!!!\n\nYou can&#8217;t possibly be serious or you are simply still full on asleep&#8230;.60 minutes long agao stopped being a trusted source.                                           305                                          Reply                                                                                             Charles                    5 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Gary              \n\nBut Gary, did you see the 60-Minute segment????\r\n If not maybe you should before making your statement.  If you did could you inform us of why it cannot be trusted?  Honestly I want to know what you concluded and why.

But it&#8217;s rather unfair.  There&#8217;s no way a television show which has three segments consisting of perhaps 15 minutes apiece could be as in-depth as an article like this.                                           8                                          Reply                                                                                     Oscar                    3 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Dennis              \n\nThis article leaves out a lot of the technical details that go against its arguments. The crux of the problem with the lab origin theory is in the difficulty in replicating Covid-19 without cheating by reverse-engineering a virus after the fact.                                           -2                                          Reply                                                                                     Bruce Wing                    5 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Robert Schaefer              \n\nFair comment. Maybe a better statement by the author would have been, “The overwhelming majority of the coverage on this subject has supported the contention that the lab leak hypothesis is a hoax, but it does appear that some outlets are beginning to take the hypothesis more seriously.”                                           50                                          Reply                                                                                     Phil                    4 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Robert Schaefer              \n\nWhy does that even matter.

It has a higher chance of being detected there as there’s an active virology lab there.                                           -9                                          Reply                                                                                     Rich Seidner                    5 months ago                                                 There&#8217;s no mention of the speed with which this family of viruses evolves over time.  Early scientific reports suggested years between mutations.\n\nI&#8217;m hoping that eventually, the sequence (no pun intended) of genetic variations will be identified.                                           24                                          Reply                                                                                             nhz                    5 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                Rich Seidner              \n\nThis virus is evolving relatively slowly for a virus but new versions &#8211; with usually just a few point mutations &#8211; appear on a daily basis thanks to many millions of potential &#8216;incubators&#8217;. There are thousands of genetically different versions (&#8216;strains&#8217;) by now, even though only a minority of detected cases are fully sequenced. There are websites where you can track the spread of certain variant strains across the globe.\r\n Most of these mutations probably have little or no influence on virus properties, but some strains might be more (or less) contagious or pathogenic &#8211; we simply don&#8217;t know.                                           29                                          Reply                                                                                             Tim Priest                    5 months ago                                                       Reply to&nbsp;                nhz              &#8220; &#8230; some strains might be more (or less) contagious or pathogenic&#8230;&#8220;\n\nYes.

The Chinese have prevented a proper investigation from ever possibly being conducted and has even openly engaged in punitive tariffs against countries merely wanting one. Plus the CPP spread conspiracy theories about the virus starting in the US with zero evidence.                                           -1                                          Reply                                                                                     Pathcoin                    5 months ago                                                 \n\nThis is an excellent review. It points to the fact that in this type of work detectives are required as the lead investigators, with scientists playing a secondary technical role. If we look at this from a detective point of view, our thought processes should follow MOM (means, opportunity, motive). Of the three, motive (escape vs purposeful release) is the most difficult to discern. If we look at the evidence from a journalistic point of view (who, what, when, where, how and why) we have a similar but slightly more detailed understanding.

I have long thought it was the original virus taken from the Yunnan caves which accidently escaped, but this article shows it was a human-modified version. Release was still definitely accidental, because only a total nutter would deliberately release a deadly virus on their own doorstep.

Why might that be? Either they are drastically lying about the true toll of the pandemic there, or they were prepared for this virus from the beginning.                                           9                                          Reply                                                                                     Alex M                    5 months ago                                                 \n\nThank you for this very interesting article.

We created an environment perfectly suited for air-borne global pandemics if the virus is infectious before people become sick. That global panemic-enabling environment has three components: (1) large cities with dense populations, (2) mass transit and (3) a global air transport industry. If a virus gets out, it creates a global pandemic before the people in the city where it started know it exists. The problem is similar to many American cities burning down in the 1800s (Chicago, Boston, etc.).

But looking at the disease statistics a more effective and cheaper solution than massive engineering efforts (which makes people dependent on those engineering solutions) would be to do something about co-morbidities like obesity that seriously increase disease risk. Or providing a bit more fresh air and clean walking space for the average citizen (instead of locking people down in a small home).

But it&#8217;s hugely important when it comes to preventing future pandemics. If the research that supposedly protects us from zoonotic spillovers is in fact increasing the net pandemic risk (due to human error, accident, etc), then that research needs to be halted. At the very least, it should be limited and done only under tightly controlled conditions. This would require international agreement, and perhaps an auditing regime with actual teeth.

Obsession with the source is exactly what is needed in order to come up with a preventative solution.  The strategy is very different if the source is natural vs accidental lab release.

Singapore for example noted that the 2009 Swine flu came in and spread unimpeded (even with their ubiquitous masks); fortunately there were few deaths (this was NOT a lesson learned from SARS, which was mostly a hospital infection, though more deadly). Having a health check choke point at borders is simple 1950s Public Health protocol. Singapore has done an excellent job corralling, testing, quarantining and treating the infected, and their close contacts, that get by the cordon.

Human had been fighting pandemics for thousands of years, and every single one of them was created by Mother Nature. And there has been no lack of conspiracy theories (often state sponsored), e.g. that AIDS was created in a CIA lab. In the case of AIDS, US government has never been asked, nor it has never offered a proof that AIDS was not lab made, but people generally believed that it was created by Mother Nature. Fast forward, there is this theory of lab leakage of coronavirus.

(Tom Cates via AP)             LAS VEGAS (AP) — A man suspected of being in the U.S. illegally shot and killed four people in Nevada over the past two weeks, including an elderly Reno couple, authorities said, and the slayings added fuel to the immigration debate.\n\nWilbur Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, 19, from El Salvador, has been jailed in Carson City since Saturday on possession of stolen property, burglary and immigration charges. Authorities said they expect to file murder charges against him in Reno in the shooting deaths of a Washoe County couple and in Douglas County in the slayings of two women in Gardnerville.ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said federal immigration authorities told his office that Martinez-Guzman was in the country illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not have details on his entry into the U.S.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, the sheriff said, and it was too early to comment on a possible motive.\n\nInvestigators who had been tracking Martinez-Guzman considered him “an imminent threat” when they arrested him Saturday afternoon in the parking lot of a shopping mall.\n\n“We couldn’t account for him Friday night, and we couldn’t predict what he would do Saturday night,” Furlong told The Associated Press. “It was too great a risk to the public not to make the arrest.”\n\nDetectives had watched Martinez-Guzman go to a car wash and trash bins, raising concern that he might try to dispose of evidence connected to the slayings. He did not have a weapon when he was handcuffed, the sheriff said.\n\nThe suspect did not yet have an attorney who could speak on his behalf, according to the sheriff.\n\nPresident Donald Trump seized on the killings as evidence of the need for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n“Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,” Trump said Monday in a tweet. “We need a powerful Wall!”\n\nThe killings are the latest crimes Trump has cited to bring attention to the wall, which is at the center of his battle with Democrats that has shut down much of the federal government.\n\nSince the start of his presidency, he has highlighted crimes committed by immigrants who were here illegally, including the killing of a 32-year-old woman at a San Francisco pier in 2015. Last month, he tweeted about allegations that a man from Mexico fatally shot a California police officer.ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany academics and Trump’s critics have pushed back on the president’s narrative, citing studies that have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.\n\nThe Nevada suspect, who was due in court Thursday, had lived in the Carson City area for about a year. His only known infraction was a speeding ticket, the sheriff said.\n\n“We have no information this guy has ever been on anyone’s radar,” Furlong said.\n\nThe investigation began Jan. 10, when 56-year-old Connie Koontz was found dead in her home. Three days later, the body of 74-year-old Sophia Renken was discovered in her home about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where Koontz lived, authorities said.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the bodies of 81-year-old Gerald David and his 80-year-old wife, Sharon, were found in their home on the southern edge of Reno.\n\nThe two were remembered as “jovial” by Tom Cates, a longtime friend who knew the Davids through Reno’s rodeo and equestrian scene.\n\nCates said Gerald David used his time as the Reno Rodeo Association president in 2006 to promote a breast cancer awareness campaign by getting the group’s cowboys to show they were “tough enough to wear pink shirts.”\n\n“You walk into a room and his presence will just command attention. He was a true leader,” Cates said.\n\nSharon David was “exuberant” and “bubbly” and “loved animals to the hills,” he said. She was a former director of the rodeo.\n\nRenken belonged to an antique automobile club and was known as the friendly driver of a Ford Model A who was always volunteering to help.\n\nRobin Reedy, who was also in the Carson-Tahoe Region of the Antique Automobile Club of America, said she was surprised to learn Renken’s age.\n\n“I would never have known she was 74 by the way she acted,” she said.\n\nKoontz, who worked at a Walmart and as a manicurist at a local salon, was remembered by co-workers Tuesday as a positive woman who loved wearing bright colors. Her Walmart colleagues wore memorial buttons with her picture.\n\nShe was “the only person I know that could come to work wearing lime green glasses and lime green crocs and rock it,” said Teri Bower, who works at the store.\n\nKoontz and her daughter were best friends, Bower said, and the mother had saved up money and surprised her daughter with a trip to Las Vegas for her 21st birthday in December.\n\nBower said the killings had shaken the quiet community where everyone knows everyone and big news is a pending storm “or a bear running down Main Street.”\n\n“This does not happen around here,” Bower said. “It’s crazy.”\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the suspect’s age to 19, not 20.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Las Vegas, Elliot Spagat in San Diego and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this story.AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms &amp; ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

It does seem that we have blinders on sometimes. Honestly, the United States has so much and dominates so much culture it isn&rsquo;t very hard to think that this is all there is. Exploring both historical and modern maps can bring the rest of the world into focus. Exploring map based infographics can be very enlightening as you try to understand relationships between all parts of the globe.\n\nI had the pleasure of taking a cruise around the Mediterranean a few years ago.&nbsp;My wife and I had such a great time exploring the historical places and artifacts and&nbsp;the life of strange cities. I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great&nbsp;if the Mediterranean wasn&rsquo;t so far away?\n\nWell, I was examining maps and globes and realized that the Mediterranean Sea&nbsp;is at the same Latitude as the United States.&nbsp;If only it&nbsp;were possible to rotate the Mediterranean Sea around to our side of the planet? Would it fit? What effect would this have? What about the states&hellip; new coastlines in the middle of the country&hellip; new relationships&hellip; states torn in pieces?\n\nA couple of screen captures, lots of graphic manipulation and now we know.&nbsp;The Mediterranean Sea fits within the confines of the United States of America. In a way, it is pretty amazing how big the Mediterranean Sea is.&nbsp; We always think if the United States as a vast country, more than 3000 miles&nbsp;from east coast to west coast. It&nbsp;used to be quite a task to traverse that distance.&nbsp;Amazingly, ancient mariners of the Mediterranean&nbsp;traversed similar vast areas of water for their commerce, and conquests.\n\nSo, what have we done? This is a new vision of the United States of America. A few states have been unaffected by this mash-up.&nbsp; Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Main and Florida.&nbsp;Yes, I am ignoring Alaska and Hawaii since they are remote, sorry.\n\nIt&rsquo;s interesting to note that by adding the Black Sea, it nicely takes the place of our own Great Lakes. The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec get new coastlines, but Lower Ontario becomes an isolated piece on the US side. A Canadian interloper if you will.&nbsp;Although the Great Lakes are very large, I believe the&nbsp;area of the Black Sea is larger than the combined Great Lakes. In this alternate US the remaining areas of the Great Lakes become great grassy plains&hellip; perhaps, International Park Reserves, or snatched up by neighboring states.&nbsp;Michigan loses a large portion of its &ldquo;mitten&rdquo; and the upper peninsula becomes the state it always wanted to be, Superior.\n\nThe &ldquo;rust belt&rdquo; area of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania would approximate the area of Turkey.&nbsp;Illinois becomes a state of great island outcroppings and the &ldquo;Aegean Sea&rdquo; becomes the &ldquo;Illinois Sea&rdquo;. Kentucky hugs the southern coastline of the new &ldquo;rust belt&rdquo;. The Greek Islands of Karpathos and Rhodes would be part of Kentucky. What a history to explore.\n\nThe South has been largely supplanted by the &ldquo;Confederate Sea&rdquo;, the eastern arm of the Mediterranean. The southern states have been effectively&nbsp;cut in half. Oddly, mirroring the Turkish grab of part of the Island of Cyprus, West Virginia has grabbed a part of this alternate Cyprus that is mostly in Virginia. The State of Tennessee has been reduced to a portion of the former Island of Crete.\n\nMissouri would take most of the Greek peninsula, the Peloponnese, most of Crete,&nbsp;and many islands. Iowa gains great rocky coastlines on both the east and west.&nbsp;The new &ldquo;Plains Sea&rdquo;, that&nbsp;takes the place of the former &ldquo;Adriatic Sea&rdquo;, reaches into North Dakota and cuts South Dakota into the new states of&nbsp;East Dakota and West Dakota. West Dakota is the new Tuscany and East Dakota approximates Croatia.&nbsp;Nebraska is now the main &ldquo;boot&rdquo; of Italy with coast on the east and west.&nbsp;Kansas takes over the &ldquo;toe&rdquo; of Italy&nbsp;and Sicily (except Colorado has made a foothold on the west tip).\n\nThe &ldquo;Tyrrhenian Sea&rdquo; along the west coast of the Italian peninsula becomes the &ldquo;Nebraska Sea&rdquo; and reaches all the way up to Montana and the Custer&rsquo;s Battlefield Monument.&nbsp; Wyoming has split into the new state of Yellowstone (with the&nbsp;amazing Yellowstone Park)&nbsp;and the Wyoming Islands (Corsica and the Northern part of Sardinia). Idaho gains new coastline.\n\nTexas, New Mexico and Colorado have a great new coastline.&nbsp;Although Colorado has been mostly swallowed up and&nbsp;maintains the southern&nbsp;part of Sardinia and an outpost on Sicily.\n\nUtah has split into the coastal area along the northern edge of Arizona and the Great Salt Islands.&nbsp;Nevada has lost the southern portion to a new state called Las Vegas.&nbsp;In return they&nbsp;get a Mediterranean coastline. I think that would be a good trade.&nbsp;\n\nThe new &ldquo;Sea of California&rdquo;, the western outlet,&nbsp;splits the state into Northern California and Southern California&hellip; most Californians want that anyway. This leads us to the &ldquo;Strait of Pismo&rdquo; and out to the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;There just may be a &ldquo;Rock of Pismo&rdquo; in place of the &ldquo;Rock of Gibraltar&rdquo;.&nbsp;Not quite the cache&rsquo;&hellip; I would say.\n\nSo, a brave new alternate United States of America with its great inland sea.&nbsp;What a different world it might have been, or might be in another alternate world.

Joe Biden’s Treasury Department has announced Thursday an invasive new initiative tasking the federal government to audit virtually all financial transactions of Americans with bank accounts holding at least $600.    The Treasury document, called “General Explanations of the Administration’s Fiscal Year 2022 Revenue Proposals,” outlines how every individual bank account with over $600 will be monitored by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).    “This proposal would create a comprehensive financial account information reporting regime. Financial institutions would report data on financial accounts in an information return. The annual return will report gross inflows and outflows with a breakdown for physical cash, transactions with a foreign account, and transfers to and from another account with the same owner,” the memo states.    “This requirement would apply to all business and personal accounts from financial institutions, including bank, loan, and investment accounts, with the exception of accounts below a low de minimis gross flow threshold of $600 or fair market value of $600.”    This proposal will also “apply to crypto asset exchanges and custodians.”    Patrick Hedger, vice president of policy at the Taxpayers’ Protection Alliance told the DailyMail the Treasury’s move blatantly violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure.    “The IRS is first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, and the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures in pursuit of, of looking for wrongdoing and criminal actions, so I think this is going to run into severe Fourth Amendment headwinds,” Hedger said.    Hedger also said this targeting of lower income Americans amounts to the “ultimate regressive tax.”    “You’re going to push more folks into small cash transactions, you’re going to push more banking offshore … the big fish out there that do have sizable assets that are that are eligible for taxation offshore. This is the ultimate regressive tax,” Hedger said.     “You’re going to end up punishing the worst off among us … the lower income folks in this country have historically been the targets of aggressive IRS audits because they don’t have the CPAs and the lawyers to be able to fight back,” he added.    This tyrannical move comes in tandem with Biden’s draconian edict requiring businesses to force their employees to get the COVID injection.

John Thys/AFP via Getty Images, FILE Rental car giant Hertz announced it was buying 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles that will be available to customers starting next month.\n\nTesla stock soared on news of the massive order, and its market cap hit the $1 trillion milestone during intraday trading Monday, a feat very few U.S. companies have attained.

Eric Gaillard/Reuters, FILE The desk of car rental company Hertz is seen at Nice International airport in Nice, France, May 27, 2020.\n\nStarting in early November, the company said customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighborhood locations in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe. It will offer digitized guidance to educate customers about the electric vehicles, and soon hopes to offer an expedited electric vehicle rental booking process through its app.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and weve only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" Hertz interim CEO Mark Fields said in a statement Monday.

Ive always loved how easy and convenient Hertz makes it for me when Im traveling to my favorite places like New York, LA and Tampa and cant wait to see what they continue to have in store.\"\n\nThe move comes amid mounting pressure on the private sector and beyond to take action on climate change. The transportation sector generated the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, primarily from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes.Comments (0 )Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email this article Top StoriesNew Jersey&#x27;s 2021 gubernatorial election results 2 hours agoVaccine or test: Biden advances sweeping new mandates for private sectorNov 03, 10:43 AMNFL wide receiver driving 156 mph seconds before fatal crash: Police2 hours ago&#x27;People want us to get things done,&#x27; Biden says in response to election losses2 hours agoMeghan Markle calling: Duchess lobbies Republican senators for paid family leave4 hours agoABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren&#x27;s Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2021 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Then thousands of people started to believe him.                  By Christopher Borrelli         Chicago Tribune  |     Jul 28, 2021   at   7:00 AM                                                       \n\n Ryan “Merf” Murphy, 42, from central Illinois, unemployed, divorced, with time on his hands, had a good idea one day that kind of got out of hand. Still, he meant well. A year ago, not long after the pandemic lockdowns began, like many, he found himself hooked on the social media app TikTok. He watched more videos than he posted, and when he posted, it was nothing special: “Sleepy” Joe Biden memes, George Carlin jokes, thoughts on cancel culture; his most popular post (45,000 views) was a clip of Ruth Bader Ginsburg explaining to Stephen Colbert why a hotdog qualified as a sandwich.   \n\n Then last month, he stumbled on a good story.     Advertisement       \n\n This story you’re reading is about that story, because, for a time, I wanted to believe it.   \n\n So did a lot of others.                  Advertisement       \n\n Around Father’s Day, Merf — which is what he prefers being called — recorded a video of himself while he was driving. The news was too big to pull over or change into something more formal. He needed to get this out now. He wore a Nintendo 64 T-shirt he bought at JC Penny that afternoon and spoke breathlessly, relaying the amazing nugget of information he just learned: A local farmer in his small town was having a fuel tank removed, the backhoe struck something large, nobody knew what, a large leg bone of some sort. So “some people from California,” archaeologists, flew in, took a look and decided it was a dinosaur bone. Indeed, the largest dinosaur tibia ever discovered. Merf said the archaeologists were planning on an excavation of the farm and expected to erect an observation tent.     [Most read] Column: A concealed truth. A positive COVID-19 test. A real mess. Aaron Rodgers’ credibility is under fire as the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl hopes take a hit. »     \n\n It was all pretty exciting.             \n\n “The biggest shindig our little town has ever had,” he said.          Ryan \"Merf\" Murphy in his garage July 9 in downstate Sherman. Murphy posted a TikTok video on June 18 about a fictitious news item involving the local discovery of a dinosaur bone, which was viewed almost 700,000 times. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)      \n\n Merf lives in Sherman (pop. 4,549), just north of Springfield. He left that part out of the first video. He also left it out of the next several videos he posted about the bone. In the videos, he was earnest and big-hearted, almost Muppet-like. You liked him. You suspected he’s getting some of the facts wrong, but it was easy to give him a break because, well, he was excited, he was not a scientist, he wore a Nintendo shirt on a weekday and said official sounding things with the shaky authority of the recently deputized. He also peppered each update about the dig with fresh details: Local police wanted him to stay quiet, he was trying to get media credentials so he could ask more questions, the University of California and “Bureau of Land Management” were here with “ground penetrating radar,” trying to determine the size of the excavation site. A week after the initial video, he posted himself standing at dusk beside an open field. You couldn’t really see what was going on behind him. But it looked like something big was happening. The Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois were now in control, he said. For the next update, shot in daylight, there were even backhoes.        \n\n He also apologized: He had agreed to stay quiet about this “as a favor,” he said, because, you know, science moves slowly and there’s nothing to show yet — “nothing is going to happen anytime soon.” Many of his details seemed believable and mundane, but plenty of others were inconsistent. (He never explained why he was telling social media when he had already agreed with the authorities to stay quiet.) Still, he — and, by proxy, his rapt viewers, everyone on the down low — had quite the scoop.   \n\n Finally, in late June, after four videos and a couple of weeks of updates, he posted a new video explaining he had just received a press release from the “Department of Interior” officially explaining the situation. At which point, the video cut abruptly to pop star Rick Astley singing “Never Gonna Give You Up,” doing his famous loose-limbed shimmy. In the world of online memes, this was called a Rickroll, a good-natured gaslighting that leads the viewer nowhere, to Astley dancing.     [Most read] Days after release from prison overseas, Heather Mack faces new reality, pleads not guilty to federal charges related to gruesome 2014 killing of her mother »     \n\n The whole thing was a prank.   \n\n In fact, Merf had offered the punchline — “biggest shindig our little town has ever had” — in the very first video but few noticed. It was so poorly delivered, you might have assumed Merf was just corny.     \n\n But here’s the thing: It wasn’t a joke to everyone.   \n\n Some of those who left comments on his videos recognized the prank immediately. But many others wanted to believe the news. Even after he revealed it was a joke, followers wanted to hear more about the dig. Thousands of people believed the reports. Neighbors called and asked for directions to the site. His ex-wife called, astonished that dinosaur fossils were found in Sherman. His own mother called to hear more. Even Snopes, the longtime fact-checking website known for debunking urban legends, filed a report — concluding that Merf’s claim needed more investigation.   \n\n When Merf woke the morning after posting the first video, it had 1,200 views — modest, but lot for him. Within weeks, though, that initial report alone had gathered almost 700,000 views. He shot from 400 followers to, now, roughly 8,000. As of mid-July, he was still being asked for updates.     [Most read] A Chicago Bears move to Arlington Heights may leave thousands of fans with worthless Soldier Field seat licenses »     \n\n Merf realized that he had, in a sense, created fake news.     \n\n Or conversely, “real” news to many of those who followed him, left messages begging for more details, asked for the location of the town and the name of a nice hotel so they could vacation there and watch the dig. They left notes of congratulations on his town’s good fortune, and warnings about the inevitable federal bigfooting and media scrutiny to come. Unwittingly, Merf had entered the zeitgeist and given a master class in how easy it is to sell a tall tale in 2021. Social media, after all, is a 24-hour seminar conducted by people explaining subjects beyond their pay grade. Merf, at the very least, sounded sincere, curious, surprised. He never winked. For a hot second I wanted to believe him: A few years ago I had asked paleontologists about Illinois fossils and their replies left me ...   \n\n Unsatisfied.   \n\n Because, Merf said, “we all want something to believe in.”   \n\n Or we all hope there’s something new under the sun, I said.     [Most read] Kyle Rittenhouse judge stops proceedings, fumes about media criticism »     \n\n “Or that,” he agreed. “That part I understand. The shock was the people who wanted to believe even after I showed them, without a doubt, that I was just dragging out a dumb joke. I’m a dad and I laugh at stupid things. So truly, I don’t know what happened here. But then it’s hard to know what’s true anymore. When you left a message asking to call, I checked to see if you were real. And you exist.”   \n\n But dinosaur bones in Illinois?   \n\n Illinois is one of the handful of states where not a single dinosaur fossil has ever been extracted from the soil. Blame the ice age and the harsh scouring of its landscape. Basically, the age of the land in Illinois and the age of the dinosaurs don’t match well. “As yet, no dinosaurs are known from Illinois,” said William Simpson, head of geological collections at the Field Museum. “There were very few Mesozoic rocks (the age of the dinosaurs) exposed in our state.” Paleontologists — not archaeologists, one of the several details that Merf got wrong — have long hunted for dinosaur fossils in Illinois and many have concluded that the chance of finding any is improbable at best. Not that this stops Midwesterners from presenting Illinois paleontologists with “evidence” of local dinosaur bones.     Advertisement       \n\n “Not a week goes by when that doesn’t happen,” said Joe Devera, senior paleontologist with the Illinois State Geological Survey. A local doctor once gave him a skull, convinced it was a dinosaur. “I told him it was a cow. He said no, he knows, he’s a doctor. I said, ‘Tell me where you practice, so I make sure never to go there.’”     Advertisement       \n\n When Merf made that first video about the farmer and the fuel tank and the gigantic tibia, he didn’t know any of that. He had assumed that others knew exactly what he knew about dinosaurs. “Meaning, I never thought much about it. I forget where Sue (the famous Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Field Museum) is from. I might guess ... Illinois? People have found woolly mammoth remains in Illinois.”     [Most read] When will Illinois’ mask mandate end? COVID-19 cases are no longer dropping, leaving endgame uncertain »     \n\n Which is (actually) true. (Sue was found in South Dakota.)          Ryan \"Merf\" Murphy displays a TikTok video he created to explain that a previous TikTok video he made that went viral was actually a joke. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune)      \n\n Merf committed to the dinosaur story after he came across a TikTok video of “some dude” who told bad jokes. “The guy said, ‘Archeologists is the science of partying, because every time they dig up something, it’s a shindig.’ I thought I could do better.” He wondered what a 60-second version of the joke might look like. “I devised a script, and after about two hours, I rehearsed what I wanted to say. When you’re excited, there aren’t many pauses, so I did about eight or 10 takes then later went into the editing tools and removed the pauses to give a sense of being quick and urgent. And I was quick and precise but just before I hit publish, I thought I could do better. So I added the theme from ‘Jurassic Park.’ Then before I hit publish again, I slipped in the ‘Jurassic Park’ logo. I added also decided to add the detail about an observation tent so I could sell the idea of the town being excited. It made it seem more real. For the punchline, I looked into the camera, for two or three extra beats.   \n\n “I figure people would get it. I thought I had made a superior dad joke. I drove up to Chicago that weekend to have dinner with family and before I got there, I was up to 30,000 views. I actually had to log out of my phone because there were so many notifications coming. Some people were like, ‘Eloquent dad joke!’ I never deleted those comments. I just posted a follow-up, and by now I was googling ‘dinosaurs’ and ‘archaeology’ because some people were pointing out no, paleontologists study fossils. But I figured I could chalk that up to misspeaking in excitement. I found an article about the University of California and a Bureau of Land Management and I thought, OK, so I’ll drop those names, too. It sells the legitimacy. The more big words I used, it seemed, the more people wanted to buy it. That said, I did also start to ask myself, ‘Why do people even believe this? How could they?’”   \n\n Perhaps because you can’t tell a joke?   \n\n “Perhaps,” Merf laughed. “Actually, after 250,000 views, I reached out to a friend who’s a stand-up comic and asked for help: Where do we go with this? We started formulating ideas. He suggested a construction site as a backdrop. So I did that. By now I felt this had gone on long enough. But people were still congratulating Illinois and still asking about where they could see the dig. Even after we decided to end on a Rickroll, to finish there, I heard from people who refused to believe it was fake.”     [Most read] Chicago police union head renews call for thousands of officers to disobey vaccine reporting mandate, but department compliance jumps to 76% »     \n\n He feared revealing the prank would invite a wave of hate and he would lose good will, “because by now I had created a nice fantasy and crushed it. But the hate that came, it wasn’t like a real hate.”   \n\n It was more like sadness.   \n\n If you tried hunting around the internet for verification of an Illinois dinosaur excavation, you likely saw the Snopes article, which left the door open for more. Merf’s reporting, told with enough straight-faced guilelessness to pass through social media as plausible, blurred into the QAnon conspiracies, stories of backroom cannibal cabals conspiring to steal presidential elections, misinformation on vaccines causing magnetism, “reports” that Donald Trump would return to the White House soon. Joke or not, it seemed at home on social media. On TikTok this summer, one recurring video asks the question: What conspiracy theory do you 100% believe? That’s generated more than 15,000 replies. Never mind the legitimate news of a government report that intelligence agencies were uncertain about the origins of many UFOs. Never mind the existence of actual conspiracies: As the Atlantic’s Adam Serwer writes in his new book “The Cruelty is the Point,” Black Americans “go about their lives every day” knowing that real conspiracies — to redline, to medically experiment, to deny loans, to create forced labor — are part of our history.   \n\n Merf wasn’t acting in any ideological or political way. He wasn’t trying to make a point.   \n\n Still, politics found him.     [Most read] McDonald’s CEO sparks controversy with texts to Mayor Lightfoot saying parents of Adam Toledo, Jaslyn Adams ‘failed those kids’ »     \n\n “A lot of people who left comments believed the feds would now take control of the land of the farmer and claim eminent domain. For a while I got a lot of ‘OK, now you just watch. This guy is going to get screwed. Because that’s what government does.’” When Merf mentioned jumping through hoops to get media credentials and legitimize his reporting somehow, the comments urged him to ignore the professional channels, he had First Amendment rights — to hell with mainstream media.   \n\n On a less cantankerous note, one of the recurring themes of the comments was a concern for the day-to-day operations of the farm itself. “Which was maybe the cutest part,” Merf said. “A lot of people worried about what the farmer would do for a new fuel tank, now that his land was occupied.”   \n\n Which is nice.   \n\n “Which is heartwarming,” Merf said.     Advertisement       \n\n For the record, he’s not a conspiracy nut, he said. He has a BA in business management and organizational behavior from Benedictine University — he understands the improbability of herding enough cats to conspire about anything. “I will say, I voted for Trump, but I’m a center-leaning conservative. So, JFK Jr. is not alive. QAnon? No.” But he does want to believe in UFOs.     [Most read] The essential Chicago brewery for out-of-town visitors? We have the answer — or, actually, answers. »     \n\n We all do.   \n\n Or rather, a sizable portion of the population wants to believe. According to a recent Pew Research Center poll, the existence of alien life is one of our few shared beliefs, cutting across ideological and geographic differences. (About 65% of Americans believe something from another world is here.) Folklore itself — in Chicago alone, Resurrection Mary, Candyman, the Schiller Woods fountain of youth — is a community wish to believe there is wonder left in the world.   \n\n Why not dinosaur fossils?   \n\n Science aside, geology aside, facts aside, dinosaur fossils were found just over the Missouri line; dinosaurs probably didn’t obey nonexistent state lines 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs probably walked what became Illinois and glaciers across the Midwest probably scraped clean the evidence.   \n\n Probably — right?   \n\n Merf had considered continuing his ruse. He was planning to shoot in the dug-out foundation of a nearby construction. The popularity of the videos had been a bright spot — for the past few years, his parents have had health issues that forced him to leave his customer service job at Blue Cross/Blue Shield and help care for them full-time. But after a couple of weeks of videos, viewership declined. He sensed interesting waning. Eventually the amazing becomes ho-hum. “But for a time, hundreds of thousands out there imagined the incredible,” he said. “It’s why I watch ‘Ancient Aliens’ on the History Channel. Unless you’re an expert in a field they’re talking about, what do you know? Dinosaur fossils in Illinois would have added to the record, it would have been history. If it were true. I meant nothing malicious. I just wanted to hear, ‘How cool.’ I’m still laughing.”   \n\n cborrelli@chicagotribune.com                        Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement         Latest Entertainment        First Christmas song played on WLIT this season: “All I Want For Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey.

The year saw some of the most anticipated features from the Facebook-owned messaging app such as Dark Mode feature, Disappearing Messages option, WhatsApp Business app enhancements and more.      					        					       	 					            However, WhatsApp has always maintained that \"For the best experience, we recommend you use the latest software version of Android or iOS and all other compatible software.\"     MORE FROM THIS SECTION See All             Premium  Premium  How Bored Apes are shaking up the NFT space </span>          Premium  Premium  Facebook to shut down facial recognition in photos, videos </span>          Premium  Premium  Netflix Games: Seven things we know right now </span>          Premium  Premium  Koo creates Cricket chat tab to increase user interacti ... </span>\n\n  	Thus, come 2021, WhatsApp will stop working on a number of smartphones. As updated on the FAQ support page of the Facebook-owned messaging app, there are several Android and iOS phones that may not be able to run the app as the company will withdraw support for older versions of OS from next year.\n\n  	According to the information on WhatsApp FAQ section, WhatsApp will only be compatible with phones running Android 4.0.3 operating system or newer as well as iPhones running on iOS 9 and newer.\n\n  	For Android phones, models including HTC Desire, LG Optimus Black, Motorola Droid Razr or even the Samsung Galaxy S2 will no longer be able to have WhatsApp.\n\n  	For iPhones, iPhone 4 and earlier models will not support WhatsApp soon. Models 4S, 5, 5S, 5C, 6 and 6S will need to update their operating system to iOS 9 or later to continue using WhatsApp.\n\n  	In case of the 6S, 6S Plus and the first generation iPhone SE, they are the last to support the latest version of the newly released iOS 14.\n\n  	Apart from this, the Facebook-owned instant messaging platform will keep the app running for select phones with KaiOS 2.5.1 OS or newer, including JioPhone and JioPhone 2, it said.

However, it provides the option to export your chat history as an email attachment.\n\n  	How to know your current OS version:\n\n  	In order to find out your current operating system for phone, iPhone users can go to Settings &gt; General &gt; About, to find out the iOS version.\n\n  	For Android users, you can go to Settings and then on About Phone (which is probably at the end of the section) to see which Android version your smartphone is running on.\n\n  	Every year-end, WhatsApp ends support for older iOS and Android smartphones. In 2020 beginning, WhatsApp stopped working for Android phones running on Android 2.3.7 operating system and lower as well as iPhones running on iOS 8 and lower.\n\n  	It also stressed on the fact that these older versions of Android and iOS operating systems \"can no longer create new accounts, nor re-verify existing accounts after February 1, 2020.\"\n\n  	\r\n   	                                                      Subscribe to Mint Newsletters      *  Enter a valid email *  Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.           \n\nNever miss a story!

Comirnaty Information Pfizer-BioNTech Fact Sheets Pfizer-BioNTech Fact Sheet Translations Información sobre las vacunas para el COVID-19\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty, for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.\n\nThe vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA), including for individuals 5 years of age and older, for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised people, and for a single booster dose in people:  65 and older 	18 through 64 at high risk of severe COVID-19 	18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOn October 20, 2021, the FDA authorized the use of a heterologous (or “mix and match”) booster dose in eligible populations with currently available (i.e., FDA-authorized or approved) COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients falling into one of the authorized categories for boosters may receive  the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (half dose), Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and should be given at least six months after completing the primary vaccination.

Lightvision LLC/Getty Images\n\nYou can get a cellphone signal on the highest mountain in Colorado, and if you get lost hiking that mountain, you should probably answer your phone — even if you dont recognize the callers number.\n\nThats the message being spread by Lake County Search and Rescue, which tried to help a lost hiker on Mount Elbert by sending out search teams and repeatedly calling the hikers phone. All to no avail. The hiker spent the night on the side of the mountain before finally reaching safety.\n\n\"One notable take-away is that the subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didnt recognize the number,\" the rescue unit said on its Facebook page.   The hiker was lost on the tallest peak in the Rockies\n\nMount Elbert is the tallest peak in the Rocky Mountains with an elevation of 14,433 feet. Both of the trails leading to its summit are \"well trodden class one trails,\" the U.S. Forest Service says, meaning theyre not very technical and dont require special gear. But the South Elbert Trail that the hiker was on does have an elevation gain of about 4,800 feet, and the mountain is currently capped with snow.\n\nThe hiker set out at 9 a.m. on Oct. 18 on a route that normally takes about seven hours to complete, round-trip. A caller alerted search and rescue teams around 8 p.m., and a five-person team stayed in the field looking for the hiker until 3 a.m., when the team suspended the search.\n\nMore searchers hit the mountain the next morning, but then the hiker appeared, having finally made it back to their car. The hiker had gotten disoriented in an ordeal that lasted about 24 hours.   Rescuers hope the incident can be a teachable moment\n\nLake County Search and Rescue is using the incident as a teaching moment.\n\n\"If youre overdue according to your itinerary, and you start getting repeated calls from an unknown number, please answer the phone; it may be a SAR [search and rescue] team trying to confirm youre safe!\"\n\nIn its message about the lost-and-found adventurer, the search and rescue unit also urged hikers on the mountain to \"please remember that the trail is obscured by snow above treeline, and will be in that condition now through probably late June. Please dont count on following your ascent tracks to descend the mountain, as wind will often cover your tracks.\"\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the rescue team urged people to treat the hikers plight with respect.\n\n\"What seems like common sense in hindsight is not obvious to a subject in the moment when they are lost and panicking. In Colorado, most folks who spend time outdoors have a good understanding of the SAR infrastructure that is there to help them, but this is not the case nation-wide.\"                       Facebook       Twitter       Flipboard       Email                                                   Read &amp; Listen                               Home                 News                 Arts &amp; Life                 Music                 Podcasts                 Programs                                             Connect                               Newsletters                 Facebook                 Twitter                 Instagram                 Press                 Contact & Help                                             About NPR                               Overview                 Diversity                 Ethics                 Finances                 Public Editor                 Corrections                                             Get Involved                               Support Public Radio                 Sponsor NPR                 NPR Careers                 NPR Shop                 NPR Events                 NPR Extra                                                       Terms of Use             Privacy             Your Privacy Choices             Text Only                                                  NPR thanks our sponsors\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor                  ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-hiker-ignored-calls-rescuers/'),

Ilhan Omar faces challenge from Chris Kelley, a celebrated Iraq war veteran             By         Hollie McKay   | Fox News     Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments  Print Email Chris Kelley, who has collected eleven military medals as a 27-year veteran of the U.S. Army and Army Reserves and clocked more than 36,000 hours patrolling the Minnesota streets as a 20-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Force, has his sights set on knocking Omar from her seat representing Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District in 2020. (Courtesy Chris Kelley)\n\nWhen Rep. Ilhan Omar ignited steep controversy&nbsp;in March describing the&nbsp;September 11 attacks as “some people did something,” it was then that a longtime cop in her neighborhood decided he needed to do more than just bemoan what he perceived as a shocking trivialization of a terrorist attack that tore through the fabric of his beloved country.\n\nNow, Chris Kelley, who has collected eleven military medals as a 27-year veteran of the U.S. Army and Army Reserves and clocked more than 36,000 hours patrolling the Minnesota streets as a 20-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Force, has his sights set on knocking Omar from her seat representing Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District in 2020.\n\n“September 11 was a terrible loss of life, not just for police officers and firefighters and other first responders, but 3,000 people and non-combatants died, and to be dismissive of that was an outrage. I could sit and complain or I could do something about it,” Kelley, who is campaigning as an Independent, told Fox News. “And I believe I can be a positive voice in standing up for people in our country, and for our first responders and the people every day on the frontlines.”\n\nBRONX REPUBLICAN PREPARING 2020 RUN AGAINST BOLSHEVIK ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ\n\nIn his view, current representative Omar has devoted too much time to crafting her “celebrity” than on being of service to the community, which he insists he will serve honorably&nbsp;if elected.\n\n“As former military, I am here to serve and not further my status. I want to do a good job for the people I represent and I don’t have a personal agenda,” noted Kelley, who deployed once during Operation Desert Storm and twice during Operation Iraqi Freedom as an intelligence analyst and also holds an masters degree in Criminal Justice Leadership from Concordia University in St. Paul. “I’m passionate about service and I just want to be able to continue that.”  \n\n       Kelley deployed once during Operation Desert Storm and twice during Operation Iraqi Freedom as an intelligence analyst. He also holds a masters degree in Criminal Justice Leadership from Concordia University in St. Paul.       (Courtesy Chris Kelley)\n\nHe isn’t totally a political rookie. Kelley campaigned for the Republican Senate endorsement in 2016 and, while unsuccessful, it gave the 49-year-old a taste for what Minnesotans wanted and needed.\n\n“Immigration is a big issue right now. I believe in having a secure border; if you don’t have a country you don’t have a border and our border agents are doing a great job, but they are being overwhelmed and Congress isn’t giving them the tools they need,” he said. “But I would also like to see a pathway to citizenship for those under DACA; they couldn’t help they were brought here and need a shot to be able to stay here.”\n\nBERNIE SANDERS SAYS DEMS WILL LOSE THE ELECTION IF THEY BECOME OBSESSED WITH TRUMP\n\nKelley stressed that he also remains firmly committed to boosting Medicare, while ensuring private health insurance remains available and the costs are driven down.&nbsp;He also supports term limits on representatives of both the House and the Senate.  \n\n       U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., holds a Medicare-for-all town hall with other lawmakers, Thursday, July 18, 2019, in Minneapolis. (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nFurthermore, as the father of a 5-year-old, he also underscored the importance of addressing the ever-looming elephant in the room.\n\n“A big concern I have is our national debt, and I would like to work on bringing this down. It should be a priority,” Kelley continued. “I have a 5-year-old and this debt will be in our children’s lap.”  \n\n       “September 11 was a terrible loss of life not just for police officers and firefighters and other first responders, but 3,000 people and non-combatants died, and to be dismissive of that was an outrage. I could sit and complain or I could do something about it,” Kelley, who is campaigning as an Independent, told Fox News. “And I believe I can be a positive voice in standing up for people in our country, and for our first responders and the people every day on the frontlines.”       (Courtesy Chris Kelley)\n\nAnd despite the blatant political differences he has with Omar, the local police officer is vowing to run a “positive, fact-based campaign” that won’t entail attacking or ridiculing his opponent.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n“I won’t be bringing in controversy and scandal. I will be bringing firsthand knowledge of the things that I know are going on in the community as an officer. I see a lot every day – the homelessness, the opioid crisis;&nbsp;I want to bring these things to the forefront and put some ideas on the table on how to deal with them,” Kelley added. “I want to do anything I can to make people’s lives better; I just want to sit and listen to people and make some positive change.”  Hollie McKay has a been a Fox News Digital staff reporter since 2007.

Cartoons Podcasts       Opinions   Five myths about the Salem witch trials                 \r\n  (BROWN BROS./BROWN BROS.)        By   Stacy Schiff      October 28, 2016   Historical truths emerge only with time, after which they are ours, particularly on Halloween, to mangle. Early on, the Salem witch trials disappeared from the record; a hush descended over 1692 for generations. “The People of Salem Do Not Like to Be Questioned in Regard to the Witchery Affair” reads a Philadelphia Inquirer headline — from 1895. It fell to others to resurrect the “witchcraft,” as the South did during the debate over slavery. Then came Arthur Miller, who made off with the story, or at least a version of it. A lush mythology grew up around the trials, one that reassured us that these events took place in a remote land in no way resembling our own. In truth, they are deeply woven into the American fabric. They are more relevant than the lore suggests — our earliest instance of conspiratorial fantasy and reckless demonizing, of the brand of national distemper that grips us in anxious times.  Myth No. 1 The convicted witcheswere burned.\n\nDespite numerous debunkings, the idea that Salem’s “witches” burned at the stake persists everywhere from online forums to episodes of “The Simpsons.” Joan of Arc and tales of European witch hunts may flicker too brightly in our minds. Generally, French witches burned, while English witches hanged. (This posed a conundrum to the Channel island of Guernsey when three witches turned up there in 1617. The malefactors were hanged, then burned.)\n\nThe American South reinforced the burning-at-the-stake fiction in the 19th century. “The North . . . having begun with burning witches, will end by burning us!” screeched a popular magazine in 1860, after Lincoln’s election.\n\nWith one exception, however, all who went to their deaths in Salem hanged. (Giles Corey, an elderly Salem farmer, was crushed under stones for several days after refusing to plead guilty or innocent. He remains the only individual in American history to be pressed to death.) No one burned.     The Gallows Hill Project pinpointed the exact site of the infamous Salem witch hangings, which killed 19 people in 1692. The team identified Proctors Ledge, not Gallows Hill, as the spot of the executions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    Myth No. 2 The victims were all women.\n\nEvery October, Halloween confirms what we learned from “The Wizard of Oz”: Witches are women. Pop-culture depictions of the trials, such as the show “Salem,” focus almost exclusively on the female accused.\n\nIndeed, misogyny powered the European witch hunts of the 15th and 16th centuries, but Salem was different. Of the 19 who hanged in Salem, four were men, including a feckless, fortune-telling carpenter and a 42-year-old Harvard-educated minister. Accused witches came in every variety, from the richest of Salem merchants to the dutiful wife of a blind farmer. The terror was all the greater for its very arbitrariness; no one, noted a letter to authorities from a group of men late in the summer, had cause to think himself safe. The youngest accused witch was a 5-year-old girl. Having spent most of 1692 in miniature manacles, she wound up insane.\n\nGender did play a vital role in the hysteria. Women would not incriminate husbands, while a number of men eagerly informed the court that they had long suspected their wives to be witches. Family fingers pointed in all directions, although no son ever accused a father, or father a son. The wizards, however, attracted more attention in contemporary accounts, both for their supernatural powers and for their dignity en route to the gallows. Even skeptics assumed the worst of the Harvard-educated minister. From the start, he was thought to have been the diabolical mastermind, a role for which no woman, however nefarious, seemed qualified. Myth No. 3 The panic took place in Salem.\n\nIndeed, it began in Salem village, today Danvers, Mass., where two little girls convulsed. And indeed, the accused stood trial in the town of Salem. But witches turned up across the Massachusetts Bay Colony, ultimately in 24 communities.\n\nOne of the Salem girls named a total of 62 names; the bewitched denounced people in other towns who did not even know of their existence. They seemed to enjoy visionary powers. At his arraignment, a bluff Boston sea captain, a son of Plymouth’s founding family who was accused by someone in Salem, challenged the logic: Why would he bother to enchant people he neither knew of nor had ever met? Though he had done business with, sailed with and prayed with several members of the witchcraft court, they had no patience for his query. He went to jail.\n\nSalem remained the epicenter of the crisis, but Andover, Mass., about 15 miles away, would be most severely affected. Nearly 1 in 10 of its residents were accused of witchcraft, often by their own family members, many of whom themselves confessed to having signed satanic pacts and flown over the treetops to a diabolical meeting. Andover’s senior minister discovered that he was related to no fewer than 22 witches.  Myth No. 4 Superstition was the driving force.\n\nAs a Philadelphia reporter put it in 1895, “blind, senseless superstition” accounted for the trials, an idea that persists to this day.\n\nIn fact, piety played a greater role in Salem than superstition. The idea of witches came straight from scripture ; those who knew their Bible best believed most fervently in witchcraft. Not coincidentally, it tended to turn up in more pious homes.\n\nThe best minds in New England interpreted and adjudicated the epidemic. Those ministers and civic authorities pondered the cases scientifically. They read and reread the witchcraft literature, to which several of them had contributed. They parsed legal code. They knew their history. They worked in the sterling name of reason. The trouble was that the most literate in 1692 also happened to be the most literal. They were not so much out of their depth as they were swimming in information — “poisoned,” one critic later sniffed, “in their education.”\n\nThe Bay Colony may have qualified as the best-educated community in the history of the world in 1692. Piety correlated with literacy; rarely had so many been able to read. The majority of the adolescent girls in Salem village could read, even if they could not sign their names. Erudition and piety played greater roles in the crisis than did ignorance and superstition. Myth No. 5 Ergot poisoning was to blame for the witch trials.\n\nBehavioral scientist Linnda Caporael proposed this elegant theory in 1976: A contaminated rye supply introduced ergot poisoning to Salem, causing convulsions and hallucinations in the accusing girls. Debunked, revived and debunked again, Caporael’s theory nevertheless continues to pop up in articles about Salem and in footnotes in books about psychedelic drugs. And for good reason. If we could blame the rye, we could exonerate nearly everyone else. We would finally have a diagnosis for what might have caused a Salem girl to complain of prickling skin, to fling herself across a room, crash to the floor, fall into a trance — and report that she could see a fellow parishioner perching in the church beams above the congregation’s heads.\n\nSome of the 17th-century symptoms do appear consistent with ergot poisoning. But the hallucinating girls shared meals with non-hallucinating adults and siblings. The girls were often symptom-free, lucid and robust. Their health did not deteriorate. And in the absence of any such convulsions, plenty of grown men reported winged beasts in the fields and goblins in their parlors. The bewitched girls also vouched for a coordinated set of hallucinations, which speaks to an unusual form of imagination. Nor does ergot explain the girls’ sermon-interrupting or their inability to pray. In an earlier case, a bewitched girl could read without trouble but seized up when handed a religious text. Ergot poisoning, or St. Anthony’s fire, was moreover not unknown at the time.\n\nThe tenacity of the theory makes sense. Unresolved mysteries annoy us. When it comes to assigning blame, none of us draws a blank. If we could write the whole crisis down to ergot, we would at long last have a simple explanation for a host of oddities. We would also fall prey to the same kind of thinking that led a 17th-century New Englander — equally perplexed, equally intent on a tidy answer — to write ambulatory trees and flying neighbors down to witchcraft.\n\n Twitter: @stacyschiff\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

Picture taken November 23, 2019.  REUTERS/Angus Mordant//File PhotoOct 6 (Reuters) - Volatility in U.S. natural gas futures jumped to a record on Tuesday on the back of an energy crunch in major world markets that has sent prices soaring globally.\n\nNatural gas prices are at record levels in Europe and Asia, as major markets like China struggle to find enough fuel to meet demand that has bounced back from the coronavirus-induced downturn faster than anticipated.\n\nIn Europe, prices this year have rocketed more than 500%, on worries that current low levels of storage will be insufficient for the winter.\n\nThat has fed through to U.S. natural gas futures, which recently closed at 12-year-highs of $6.31 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).\n\nWhile that is still a far cry from prices in Europe and Asia where natural gas is over five times more expensive, the market has grown increasingly volatile as competition for limited U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports increases.\n\nIn the United States, implied volatility - a measure of expected fluctuations in the market - surged to an all-time high of 122.5% on Tuesday, topping the prior record of 117.5% reached in November 2018.\n\nPart of the reason for the wild moves is merchant commodity firms, hedge funds and other major investors in the market finding themselves exposed to unexpected price rallies. Companies that bet the wrong direction on markets are sometimes forced to shift positions quickly to cover their losses, further adding to the volatility.  read more\n\nThere have been no recent reports of hedge funds failing, but Statar, which invests in gas, reportedly lost about $130 million. By contrast, commodities giant Andurand has posted big returns due to rising prices. The natural gas market is experiencing a series of wild swings as power crunches in Asia and Europe spur panicked buying to secure supply.\n\nCompetition between Europe and Asia for limited LNG cargoes and other energy supplies has led to manufacturers curtailing activity in Europe and sparked power crises in China. Global gas prices have spiked to record highs of around $40 per mmBtu in Europe and $35 in Asia .\n\nThe last time volatility spiked so aggressively in November 2018, volume in gas traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) soared to a record 1.6 million contracts.\n\nOn Tuesday, volume on the NYMEX held around 500,000 contracts, a little higher than over the past 30 days but only the most in a day since last week.\n\nHowever, volumes in the U.S. Natural Gas Fund , an exchange-traded fund designed to track gas prices, soared over 30.2 million shares on Sept. 28, its biggest daily volume since hitting a record 43.1 million shares in November 2018.\n\nAnalysts do not expect U.S. prices to reach the lofty levels in Europe or Asia because the United States should have enough gas in storage for the winter heating season and because U.S. LNG export plants were already producing all of the super-cooled gas they can.\n\nThe United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas into LNG, or about 13% of what the nation consumes domestically.\n\nGlobal markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc&#x27;s (LNG.A) Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG&#x27;s Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.

A Florida child fatally overdosed. In communities around the country, such headlines are stoking fears that a momentary brush with a tiny amount of fentanyl powder could prove fatal.\n\nThe synthetic opioid, blamed for increasing numbers of overdose deaths across the U.S., is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. But experts consulted by STAT said many of the reported incidents appear to be false alarms that run counter to scientific fact and exaggerate the risks.\n\nThe American College of Medical Toxicology recently issued a position paper concluding that, based on what’s been publicly released, none of the recent incidents involving first responders is consistent with opioid toxicity. The doctors, who reviewed a handful of cases, said they are not challenging the truthfulness of the officers involved. Rather, they are questioning whether their reports are verified cases of poisonings that carry the hallmarks of opioid exposure.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“A lot of the symptoms are nondescript, such as vague dizziness, that don’t concern opioid poisoning,” said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and lead author of the paper. “And in a lot of the cases, the way that they were exposed doesn’t make sense, like brushing a small amount of powder off a uniform.” 		 			 				 					Related: 				 				 					After an officer accidentally overdoses on fentanyl, a police chief calls for stronger laws\n\nWhile most of the reports have involved first responders, some have involved young children, including the fatal overdose of a 10-year-old Florida boy who was found to have a mixture of heroin and fentanyl in his body. How he came in contact with opioids remains unknown, although authorities have raised the possibility that he encountered it at a community pool or walking through a neighborhood known to be a hotbed of opioid trafficking.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEstablishing the truth in these cases is not just a matter of setting the record straight, but of preventing hysteria and ensuring public safety. While accidental exposure to opioids can take lives, so can undue fear of the risks. For first responders, taking extra precautions could delay lifesaving care for people suffering overdoses and distract from more pressing threats, such as a suspect at a crime scene.\n\n“We want to prevent unintended consequences,” said Dr. Diane Calello, medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System. “If a law enforcement professional is wearing a lot of unnecessary protective gear in a situation that requires an agile response, that in and of itself is a safety issue.”\n\nConversely, failing to take proper precautions could also result in harm. So what’s the right balance?\n\nSTAT spoke to several toxicologists and law enforcement officials to examine the underlying science of fentanyl exposure and the extent of the risk it poses to first responders and the public. Can fentanyl poison officers and others through incidental skin contact?\n\nIn several incidents, officers have reportedly fallen ill after a powdered form of fentanyl came in contact with their skin or clothing.\n\nAlthough ingesting a pinch of fentanyl powder can be fatal, several toxicologists said contact with intact skin is extremely unlikely to cause opioid toxicity, which can occur only if the substance enters the bloodstream.\n\n“If you have fentanyl powder on your hand for five or 10 minutes, it’s inconceivable that that would be sufficient to cause you to have an overdose,” said Dr. David Juurlink, a toxicologist at the University of Toronto. 		 			 				 					Related: 				 				 					Why fentanyl is deadlier than heroin, in a single photo\n\nFentanyl cannot penetrate the skin on its own. It needs moisture. That’s why, in clinical care, patients are given fentanyl patches to aid in absorption and relieve pain. The position paper by the American College of Medical Toxicology reported that, even if a large area of the body were covered with fentanyl patches, it would take 14 minutes to transmit a therapeutic dose of 100 micrograms, let alone an overdose.\n\n“For the fentanyl patch to work, you have to put a lot of fentanyl in the patch. It has to be moist and it has to be in contact with the skin for a long period of time, in a special liquid,” said Stolbach. “Those aren’t the conditions that are going to occur when somebody is incidentally exposed.”\n\nOne of the most widely reported incidental overdoses occurred in East Liverpool, Ohio, where officer Chris Green became ill following a traffic stop involving drugs. Green has recovered and returned to work.\n\nThe city’s police chief, John Lane, said he believes Green’s illness resulted from opioid exposure, regardless of the questions raised by toxicologists. Lane said a screening test confirmed that Green had opioids in his body, but the exact method of exposure remains unclear.\n\nHe said Green collapsed moments after he brushed a small amount of powder off his shirt at the police station, after the traffic stop was over.\n\n“We don’t know if he brushed it off with his hand or rubbed his eye,” Lane said. “We think what may have happened is that he put on that Purel or Germ-X stuff, and that got it wet and maybe he absorbed it that way. We’re not sure. All we know is he overdosed from it.”\n\nThe medical toxicologists group specifically warns that alcohol-based hand sanitizers should never be used, because they are ineffective in removing fentanyl and may increase drug absorption. The organization said officers should take basic precautions to prevent the remote risk of poisoning through skin contact, such as wearing nitrile gloves and immediately washing with copious amounts of water if contact does occur.

Privacy Policy                         Leave this field empty if youre human:   		Can inhaling fentanyl cause an overdose?\n\nToxicologists said the possibility of accidental inhalation presents a higher risk, especially in poorly ventilated spaces where public safety officials suspect fentanyl is dispersed in the air.\n\nCalello said inhaling fentanyl — or ingesting it — puts it in contact with mucous membranes in the nose or mouth, providing the drug a way into the bloodstream, which can result in poisoning.\n\nShe added, however, that such circumstances are unlikely to arise during a traffic stop or in other open-air environments. “Handling an overdose victim is not going to entail a plume of aerosolized drug,” Calello said.\n\nIt would take prolonged exposure to a large amount of airborne fentanyl to cause an overdose, according to the medical toxicologists. Their report references safety standards for industrial workers who manufacture fentanyl. “At the highest airborne concentration encountered by workers, an unprotected individual would require nearly 200 minutes of exposure to reach a dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl,” the report states. (100 mcg, or micrograms, is enough to have a therapeutic effect but not enough to cause an overdose.)\n\n“We would expect in an industrial fentanyl production plant there’s going to be more fentanyl in the air than there would be at any crime scene,” Hopkins’s Stolbach said.\n\nStill, in cases where first responders suspect a high concentration of airborne opioids, the medical toxicologists group recommends that officers use a respirator, in addition to wearing water-resistant coveralls to block skin exposure. Why are so many officers falling ill if the risks of poisoning are so low?\n\nToxicologists said officers may indeed be getting sick following exposure to fentanyl or other substances, but that does not necessarily mean the drugs are the cause. 		 			 				 					Related: 				 				 					US and China agree to work to block the potent drug fentanyl from coming into America\n\nThe only way to confirm a case of poisoning is to conduct a urine or blood test, or to verify that symptoms were reversed by a dose of naloxone. But such evidence is lacking in many of the cases reported around the country.\n\n“The common theme is that there is no biochemical confirmation,” Stolbach said. In most cases, the media is reporting that officers are being hospitalized, but hospitalization may just be a precaution.\n\nJuurlink said the real culprit in these cases may be a phenomenon known as the nocebo effect, in which the mere suggestion that a substance can be harmful causes people to suffer negative effects after exposure. In medical research, for example, being informed of side effects related to a pill or procedure can bring on real-life symptoms.\n\n“If in a moment of panic, a person sees powder on their skin and they’ve read reports on the internet about people having overdosed, you could see how that might cause someone to at least believe they’ve had an overdose,” Juurlink said.\n\nIndeed, some of the symptoms reportedly suffered by public safety officers, such as a racing heart, dizziness, and anxiety, are more consistent with panic than opioid poisoning. “If anything, people with opioid poisoning would have a slow heart rate,” Stolbach said.\n\nToxicologists said law enforcement officials should be trained to recognize the objective symptoms of opioid poisoning so they can deliver the opioid antidote naloxone when appropriate. Those symptoms would take hold within a few minutes of exposure. A person would become sleepy and lethargic and start breathing at an abnormally slow rate.\n\n“That’s the typical progression,” Calello said. “From awake to sleepy, to asleep, to unconscious. The things that have been described in the news really are not what we typically see with patients who get opioids.” 					 					 										 					 						  					 				 										 					 						  					 				 										 					 						  					 				 						 							 					 						  					 				 										 					 						 					 				 										 					 						  					 				 										 					 						  					 				 					 				 									 													 			About the Author						 			Reprints 		  					 			Casey Ross\n\nNational Technology Correspondent\n\nCasey covers the use of artificial intelligence in medicine and its underlying questions of safety, fairness, and privacy.

(Seattle Police Department)\n\nBut Seattle officials struck an optimistic tone despite the loss of dozens of first responders, saying that public safety will remain a top priority in the city while arguing that both departments had extremely high vaccination rates.\n\n\"If someone calls 911, there will not be significant impacts on response,\" said Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan.\n\nThe city said that by Monday, 91% of the police force was vaccinated, while about 93% of firefighters had received the jab. The mayor added that about two dozen employees had yet to submit paperwork that either declared their intent to vaccinate or requested an exemption to the rule.  \n\n       istock       (iStock)\n\n\"We’re in much better shape than we thought we would be because so many people have done exactly what we asked them to do,\" Durkan said.\n\nBut Seattle has already faced an issue of declining numbers in its police force, leading some to question the wisdom of sending officers packing due to the mandate.\n\n\"Sadly, this mandate will remove over 100 officers as it stands, and that’s unacceptable,\" said the Seattle Police Officers Guilds Mike Solan.\n\nThe guild argued that emergency response times will suffer due to the sudden shortage of officers, adding that the number of employees who will be forced out is larger than the official city tally.\n\nSeattle Fire Department Chief Harold Scoggins said that while it will hurt the department to lose good employees, hes confident that his firefighters will still be able to meet the needs of residents.  \n\n              (Seattle Police Department / Facebook)\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We may lose some folks, but we’re confident we’re going to get a unit out the door to respond,\" Scoggins said.  \n\nMichael Lee is a writer at Fox News.

Through the first four months of the 2021 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded nearly 300,000 apprehensions at the border. For comparison, in all of FY 2020, CBP apprehended just 458,088 individuals.\n\nIf the current trends hold month-to-month, then FY 2021 could approve nearly 900,000 apprehensions. These would reflect the crisis months of spring and summer 2019, when even the New York Times declared that the border was at a “breaking point.” The Times’ characterization came after February 2019 apprehensions reached 76,000. In January 2021, they reached 78,232. October through December 2020 each eclipsed 70,000 apprehensions. By the Times’ logic, we are in a second border crisis, and have been in each month of FY 2021.\n\nYet things are different this time around. The obvious difference between summer 2019 and today is the raging COVID-19 pandemic, and the subsequent lockdowns and shutdowns that created widespread economic chaos and led to near-record unemployment rates. Yet the biggest difference is the change in the White House, and the 180-degree turn in immigration policy that accompanied said change.\n\nJoe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 election and became president on January 20, 2021. Throughout Biden’s campaign, he promised to amnesty every illegal alien in the United States, restore and expand the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, overturn all of President Trump’s immigration executive actions, raise the refugee ceiling to over 100,000, end successful bilateral agreements with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, and halt construction of the border wall. By early February, Biden signed a slew of executive orders and issued policy memoranda pursuing many of these goals.\n\nThese actions will have consequences. Immigration experts and journalists already noted that Biden’s campaign trail rhetoric was sure to attract illegal aliens to the United States, drawn to the border by Biden’s promises to eviscerate immigration enforcement, halt deportations, and reward lawbreakers with citizenship. Further, Biden’s ending of the Migrant Protection Protocols and asylum agreements means that our immigration authorities are now simply releasing illegal aliens into the interior of the country again with nothing more than a summons for immigration court. This practice – catch and release - fueled earlier migration surges and led to the Trump administration’s short-lived policy of “Zero Tolerance” in a desperate effort to stem the tide.\n\nAnd therein lies the fundamental difference between the spring-summer 2019 crisis and today’s growing threat at the border – Trump and the immigration enforcement agency heads actually tried to do something about it. President Biden and his team have no plan to address it.\n\nThe Biden border crisis is already here, and yet no one is talking about it because the COVID-19 pandemic overshadows the growing apprehension numbers, even as Biden is coming under fire for ordering the release of illegal aliens into the interior of the country without even testing them for COVID-19. Unless the Biden administration changes course – and quickly – the Biden border crisis is going to only grow worse and worse.

Sharing the clip, she urged people to pay close attention to her black dog.\n\n“Sorry for the obnoxious barking at the beginning. Watch my black dog. [A] ghost takes her collar off in her crate,” she wrote in the video’s caption.\n\nIn the video, you see the two dogs, who are in separate crates barking at each other in what appears to be a living room.RecommendedTikTok has a new Squid Game filter - and it’s even scarier than the robot dollMan receives bizarre text from date’s mum - but it’s weirder than it first seemsMum reveals huge difference in size 14 jeans despite buying from same shop\n\nBoth dogs bark profusely until around the 23-second mark in the video when the pups ceased all noise, standing alert for a moment.\n\nThe black dog, who is in the crate to the right begins to whimper and then suddenly jumps back into a corner of the crate, seemingly trying to avoid something once its collar randomly pops off.\n\nSign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter\n\nIt was at this moment that the owner was certain that a ‘ghost’ was responsible—and others agreed.\n\nSince the video was posted, it accrued over 1.3 million views at the time of writing and over 43,600 comments from people who think it’s a ghost as well.\n\n“They both got super quiet...they felt the energy,” someone wrote.\n\n“I’ve never seen such a convincing ghost video,” another added while a third noted that a seeming entity messing with dogs “doesn’t sit right” with them.\n\nOn the other hand, others believed there were logical explanations as to why the collar magically came off, with some saying that it was “stiff fabric” that caused the collar to unclasp or it simply “came off by accident and the dog got scared.”\n\nNo matter what transpired, it’s safe to say that the case of the fallen collar appeared to be creepy nonetheless.More About: TikTokGhost       back to topUser PoliciesPrivacyCookiesFeedbackAbout indy100ArchiveTrending Elon Musk wants to open a university with a very immature name2021-10-29T11:02:22.000ZAmazon driver fired after video of woman leaving his van goes viral2021-10-31T11:42:15.000ZMelania gave a priceless facial expression after looking at Trump2021-10-31T14:09:07.000ZMan criticised for shaming his wife for bleeding after giving birth2021-10-31T13:28:32.000ZWoman shocked after she found out she was pregnant on the toilet2021-10-30T16:13:20.000ZSister accused of ‘upstaging’ bride after 100-pound weight loss2021-11-01T09:01:29.000ZMAFS Australia’s Jessika Power reveals her hilarious UK bucket list2021-10-29T15:13:44.000ZWhen do the clocks go back and will we lose or gain an hour of sleep?2021-10-30T11:22:32.000ZWoman claims her life is harder because she is ‘attractive’2021-11-01T09:39:36.000ZWoman discovers she’s accidentally been exposing herself to neighbours2021-10-29T09:26:29.000ZBabysitter who called cops on mom questions if she did the right thing2021-10-30T08:09:01.000ZCNN reporter confronts PM over being maskless next to Attenborough2021-11-03T10:06:42.000ZInfluencer sparks outrage posing for photos on Holocaust memorial2021-11-02T08:24:05.000ZCaitlyn Jenner: Dave Chappelle is ‘100% right’ in Netflix row2021-10-28T08:10:36.000ZBoris Johnson at the G20 Summit has sparked Benny Hill comparisons2021-10-31T10:36:20.000ZWhy was there a bottle of BBQ sauce in Zuckerberg’s Meta presentation?2021-10-29T08:35:55.000ZQAnon saddened that long-dead JFK Jr did not appear in Dallas2021-11-03T00:11:01.000ZTrump Jr just self-owned his father over the Tomahawk chop controversy2021-11-01T12:21:15.000ZTrump caught laughing at ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ chant at baseball game2021-11-01T10:23:46.000ZHusband made his wife ‘guess’ which family member had died2021-11-02T12:30:07.000ZKeanu Reeves filmed helping John Wick production crew move equipment2021-10-29T14:49:14.000Z10 of the best celebrity Halloween costumes of 20212021-11-02T09:04:53.000Z‘Halloween Kills’ accused of homophobia due to murder of a gay couple2021-10-29T15:20:08.000ZFunniest memes and jokes about Facebook changing its name to ‘Meta’2021-10-29T07:37:18.000ZMike Pompeo looks unrecognizable after dramatic weight loss2021-11-03T12:42:21.000ZThe difference between Trump and Biden in just 14 seconds2021-11-01T14:16:23.000ZRepublican’s attempt to troll Greta Thunberg completely backfires2021-11-02T10:18:29.000ZBoris Johnson’s Roman Empire comments trigger backlash from historians2021-10-31T16:54:36.000ZFemale MMA fighter confirms she’s ok following intergender match2021-11-03T11:38:59.000ZMan jailed for disguising himself and taking driving tests for others2021-05-31T07:21:22.000ZWoman asks neighbours for help to catch her ‘cheating’ boyfriend2021-10-30T08:03:43.000ZMan with ‘world’s largest penis’ reveals all2021-08-06T15:53:04.000ZJake Paul vows to donate $10m to end world hunger – on one condition2021-11-02T11:38:41.000ZPhoto of PM maskless next to David Attenborough causes uproar2021-11-02T14:47:12.000Z‘Let’s Go Brandon’: the new meme MAGA fans are using against Biden2021-10-10T10:55:32.000ZDad praised for respectful way he takes daughter into women’s loos2021-10-28T14:33:41.000ZWho won today’s PMQs?

It’s like listening to East Germans, that were surveilled by STASI psychopaths 24/7 before the Wall was moved, explaining how free they became (at least until 2 years back) even as they exhibit the same nauseating “smart” phone ticks and prosthetic brain addictions as their thoroughly brainwashed cousins in the West while they themselves, without question, pay through the nose for this constant monitoring of their lives and interference from goons and &#8220;nudging&#8221; by the psychopaths that own the so-called &#8220;social media platforms&#8221; of Fecesbook, Twatter, EweTueb, Goggle and ilk&#8230;&#8221;safe&#8221; spaces where the sheeple bleat.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Though the STASI orphans should have known better, they too have already been consumed whole by trans humanist Mickey Mouse BS so the logical next step for the reptilians in charge is to pump their graphene oxide and nano dirt directly to their ovine brains and put them under complete remote control where monkey man never again has to miss a Twatter outburst or a Goggle command or Fecesbook &#8220;breaking news&#8221; fart or whatever crap they get from their blinking, prosthetic, vital organ when they deep dive into their amoled glass swamp. By all means you four-legged critters of the herd do download the &#8220;essential updates&#8221; in your monthly covaids “booster” death vaxx squirt to become a truly fulfilled silicon meat puppet like the rest of the protoplasm squirming around you. Your viper in residence and its Qr coded commands (straight from the hell that you couldn&#8217;t wait to jump into) will indeed award you with the appropriate Chicom slash NWO credits for being an obedient and soulless slave of the hell on Earth they are now erecting for the dying herd as the last stage of this dystopian farce plays out.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Otherwise kill your diabolic “smart” phone or shut up already. If you can’t do something that simple yourself, as one who claims to “get it”, then why should you expect the herd not to willfully poison itself considering they are no longer in control of anything in their miserable existences other than shoving stuff in their facial orifice or squeezing shit out their sphincter end as the case may be, in between perusing their &#8220;smart&#8221; phone smut and kitty litter videos, as they proudly and dutifully exhibit their covaids death squirt status Qr code to every jackbooted robopig thug that demands compliance as they go about their shameful and soon to be terminated lives&#8230;all in the prurient interest of course of the demons that unleashed this genocide and &#8220;watched over by machines of love and grace&#8221;. When the 5G towers and soon the 6G towers light up in the coming Dark Winter then the real electronic gulag will become apparent to even the most challenged leg of mutton out there in the pathetic human herd.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Never let any psychopath in your pocket or your life that is obviously &#8220;smarter&#8221; than you.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n &nbsp;\r\n “Smart” phone macht dumb\r\n But PfiZer macht frei &#8230;. permanently\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Same as it ever waZ\r\n &nbsp;       4       Reply             SJ Sherbs    16 days ago                Reply to&nbsp;  Malatok   \n\nOmmm&#8230;.

Full Story\n\nCargo ships are backed up in record numbers at U.S. ports, as Americans’ demand for imported goods runs up against the ability of shippers and transporters to unload those goods and transport them to warehouses and consumers.  \n\nBut some social media posts claim, without citing evidence, that the Biden administration is keeping the ships backed up on purpose. They misleadingly imply the cargo backup is part of a plan to create shortages and later inflate fourth-quarter data to take credit for a strengthening economy.                   Container ships are anchored by the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles as they wait to offload on Sept. 20. Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nOne  Facebook post  says the Biden administration is “orchestrating” product shortages by denying foreign ships’ entry into ports around the U.S. Comments on the post picked up on that unfounded claim, sensing a coordinated plan behind a map of offshore ships. “ Welcome. To. Communist. America. Where. The. Government. Creates. Shortages. To. Go. Along. With. Their. Covid. Hysteria. And. Mandate. After. Mandate,” one said.  \n\nAnother  post  links to the same image, which it says is a screenshot from a tracking app. “If you want to put a sinister twist on this, imagine a government putting a choke hold on goods entering the U.S.,” the post says. “Then, releasing everything in October they brag about the surge in 4th quarter spending and the robust economy they&#8217;ve created.”  \n\nIn fact, c argo traffic has been rising since the pandemic took hold, as homebound Americans began ordering goods online, with  a record number of ships  waiting to enter ports at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Marine terminals and trucking companies have been unable to keep up with the volume, resulting in bottlenecks at ports and rail yards from California to New York.     Consumer Demand for Imported Products\n\n“It’s a pandemic-driven buying surge unlike one that we’ve ever seen from the American consumer,” Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, said at a press conference in February. Meanwhile , COVID-19 has kept many workers away from their jobs, and rail, truck, terminal and vessel operators are struggling to keep up, Seroka said.   \n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated a situation that’s been building for years, as growing consumer demand for imported products comes up against an aging supply chain,  John McLaurin, president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, said in an interview with FactCheck.org.  \n\n“We’ve never seen this amount of cargo,” McLaurin said. “At some point, you can’t violate the laws of physics. You can only move it so fast; you can only pile it so high, and then you just run out of space. We’re at that point, and we have been for a while.”  \n\nIndustry officials and observers dismissed the idea that the Biden administration is deliberately causing the logjam. “That’s not something anyone in the industry is talking about,” McLaurin said. “I just don’t see that.”\n\nThe problem isn’t unique to the U.S., he noted. “It’s happening all over the world. There’s congestion throughout the supply chain.”   \n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated that congestion, as consumers shifted spending to goods and away from travel and entertainment,  overwhelming the supply chain ,  the Washington Post reported.\n\n“Because of the pandemic, there was a huge spike in demand, and obviously that increased U.S. imports from Asia,” Saravanan Kuppusamy, assistant professor at Rowan University’s Rohrer College of Business, told us in a joint phone interview with a colleague, Qazi Shaheen Kabir.\n\nWest Coast ports, which handle the bulk of U.S. imports from Asia, are feeling much of the strain, Kuppusamy said.     \n\nThe Port of Los Angeles saw  near-record traffic in August , and expects “significant volume headed our way throughout this year and into 2022,” Seroka said at a press briefing in September.     Limited Infrastructure and Shortage of Labor\n\nPorts and warehouses are overwhelmed with cargo containers that have nowhere to go. A shortage of chassis — the platforms used to transport containers once they are unloaded from ships — is contributing to the backup, as vessels arriving at ports can’t offload their cargo, Kuppusamy said.   \n\n“If you have a system that has limited capacity across the board and a spike in demand, most parts of the supply chain system will not be able to function fully,” Kuppusamy explained. “That will create this cumulative effect of reduced product flow throughout the supply chain.&#8221;\n\n“The current administration has inherited that infrastructure with limited capacity,” said Kabir, also an assistant professor at Rowan. Biden’s  proposed infrastructure package  includes billions of dollars in funding for port infrastructure, as well as money for rail, and the administration has formed a task force on supply chain disruption and named a  “port envoy”  to work to resolve the congestion at U.S. ports, Kabir noted.  \n\n“All these things collectively probably weaken the argument significantly that the Biden administration is slowing things down, or they are not serious about this issue,” Kabir said.  \n\n“Incentive alignment,” such as offering port workers bonuses tied to faster processing of cargo, could help the situation, Kabir added. “We often see that if your payment is fixed irrespective of your output, you do not get motivation.”\n\nThere continue to be shortages of workers at ports as well as shortages of truckers to drive cargo from the ports, said Gad Allon, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. That’s true “at almost every port around the world,” he said.  \n\nAcross the supply chain, “people are waiting on the sidelines to decide whether they really want to go back to work,” Allon said. FedEx Corp., he noted, recently  cut growth projections  and said the labor market was partly responsible. “The shortage of drivers and trucks and port workers is a global phenomenon,” he said.\n\n“No one wants to work in these conditions,” Allon continued. Companies are offering incentives – such as Amazon’s recent announcement of  tuition reimbursement  — to entice people to work for them, he noted.   \n\nA coalition of transport groups, including the International Chamber of Shipping, wrote an  open letter  to world leaders calling for an end to “fragmented” travel rules and seeking priority vaccination status for transport workers. “It is of great concern that we are also seeing shortages of workers and expect more to leave our industries as a result of the poor treatment they have faced during the pandemic, putting the supply chain under greater threat,” the letter said.  \n\n“The issue with systems that are highly congested is that any small disruption multiplies and amplifies the waiting time,” Allon said, comparing the port situation to a traffic backup resulting from a lane closure.   \n\n“It’s a system that is just completely overwhelmed and drowning in cargo at this point,” McLaurin said. “Everybody’s trying to do the best job they can to work their way through it.”  \n\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations  working with Facebook  to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Viral photo of pricey Target turkey is several years old, shows pricing error     If Your Time is short     \n\nThe viral photo of a frozen turkey priced at over $123,000 at Target is outdated, and the price was listed in error. The photo was posted online as early as 2015.&nbsp;      See the sources for this fact-check     As supply chain issues mount, some Facebook users are sharing an image that purports to show a turkey for sale at Target for an eye-popping price: $123,199, and $9,999.99 per pound.\n\n\"No Turkey for Thanksgiving this year,\" said one such Facebook post uploaded Oct. 12.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) \n\nSome Facebook users who reacted to the post blamed President Joe Biden for the crazy cost the viral image showed, leaving comments such as \"inflation is killing us\" and \"thanks Joe.\" \n\nAn Oct. 12 Facebook post falsely claimed this old photo was \"this year.\"  Featured Fact-check                 Kimberly Klacik    stated on October 13, 2021 in a tweet         An image of empty grocery store shelves shows the effect of President Joe Bidens “Build Back Better” plan.             By Bill McCarthy • October 13, 2021\n\nBut while supply chain backlogs could affect the cost and availability of Thanksgiving turkeys, the photo of a $123,000 bird at Target is several years old — and it’s nowhere near reflective of the true cost of a frozen turkey at the retail and grocery giant, which is many times lower.\n\nPolitiFact found the same photo posted in November 2015 on Reddit and the image sharing service Imgur. The price tag in the photo also includes an expiration date of April 15, 2016. \n\nThe price tag lists a Target store at the Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis as the location of the photo, and PolitiFact confirmed that the pricing was an error at a single store in 2015. The Reddit user who appears to have first uploaded the image in November of that year wrote on the forum that he brought the turkey to a cashier, but \"the ticket didn’t have a barcode to scan.\"\n\nThe $123,000 price is exponentially higher than the cost of a frozen turkey at Target — or at other U.S. grocery stores, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \n\nTarget’s website currently shows that similarly sized frozen turkeys are going for a max price of about $23 at the same location in Minneapolis, and $1.39 per pound.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post False.

Now, the text may provide insight about Petito’s final moments, her relationship with Laundrie and his role in her homicide. Who is Stan? Possible meanings for Gabby Petito’s final text. \n\n“Can you help Stan, I just keep getting his voicemails and missed calls,” Petito’s final text reads according to a North Port, Florida, police warrant.\n\nRELATED: 30 Important Domestic Violence Lessons To Learn From The Gabby Petito Brian Laundrie Case\n\nThe bewildering text has a variety of possible meanings according to police documents and internet crime sleuths. Stan was Gabby Petito’s grandfather.\n\nThe most straightforward of theories comes from unsealed police documents that say “Stan” is the name of Petito’s grandfather. \n\nHowever, her mother, Nicole Schmidt, told police that Petito never referred to her grandfather by his first name. \n\n“The mother was concerned that something was wrong with her daughter” after getting the message, according to the warrant.Brian Laundrie could have been texting from Petito’s phone.\n\nThe text may have been sent by Laundrie as an attempt to distract her family or convince them that Petito was alive. \n\nLaundrie may have been in the habit of referring to Petito’s grandfather by his first name and sent the text from her phone\n\nIt’s also possible that Petito had her grandfather’s name saved in her phone as “Stan” and Laundrie, unaware of who Stan was, texted her parents about calls that were coming into the phone. \n\nRELATED: If Gabby Petito Was A Person Of Color, Would Anyone Have Cared – Sadly, Probably Not\n\nPetito’s mother has already expressed her suspicions that Laundrie was sending messages from her daughter’s phone before the family realized she was missing. Stan may have been a code word. \n\nIn pop culture, “Stan” refers to a 2000 Eminem song about an obsessive fan who is desperate to make contact with his idol.\n\nIn the song, Stan is hostile and angry before he ties up his pregnant girlfriend and drives her off a bridge. \n\nSome have pointed to clues that Petito was pregnant before her death and may have been using the name “Stan” to warn her mother she was in danger without Laundrie noticing, in case he was checking her phone.STAN may have been an acronym.\n\nOn social media, some have suggested “STAN” could stand for “Send The Authorities Now.” \n\nPetito may have been asking for help or warning her family about the potential danger she was facing. \n\nWe know now that Laundrie and Petito had a tumultuous relationship and had been interviewed by police over a domestic dispute in Moab, Utah in which Laundrie allegedly hit Petito. Subscribe to our newsletter.Join now for YourTangos trending articles, top expert advice and personal horoscopes delivered straight to your inbox each morning.Sign up now!

Credit... Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times   \n\nBy  Deborah Schoch Published Sept. 11, 2021 Updated Oct. 20, 2021 Leng Vong Reiff had just received her second dose of a Covid vaccine and thought guiltily of her two young, unvaccinated sons. So she began banging away at her keyboard.\n\nLike countless parents across the nation, she was searching for vaccine clinical trials for children. She managed to find one, applied and got a call back.\n\n“They said that a clinic in Nebraska had an opening right now, four hours away,” she recalled. Better yet, this was a placebo-free trial, so she knew her sons would be given the bona fide vaccine.\n\nA resident of Clive, Iowa, Ms. Vong Reiff bundled Logan, 9, and Quentin, 5, into her car and raced west on Interstate 80 to the clinic, where her sons received their first shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They returned three weeks later for their second shots, protecting them for the school year ahead. And they will go back in December for antibody testing.Image Ms. Vong Reiff with Quentin, while Logan heats up food in the microwave.  Credit... Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times  Families are confronting difficult situations, now that most schools have reopened after as many as 13 months of remote teaching. As the highly contagious Delta variant has taken hold, dozens of schools around the country have closed classrooms or paused sessions, especially in states with low vaccination rates.\n\nForty-eight million children in the United States are under 12 and not eligible yet for a vaccine endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAnd about 252,000 children, including teenagers, tested positive in early September, the largest number of such cases since the start of the pandemic, according to an American Academy of Pediatrics analysis.\n\nOf those 12 through 17 who are eligible to get a Covid shot, roughly 54 percent have received at least one dose. But public health experts say it will be months before the F.D.A. decides whether the results of various clinical trials for those who are 5 to 11 and 2 to 5 merit authorizing the shots for the youngest age groups. With few options other than taking precautions like mask-wearing, some parents have even sought, through their pediatricians, off-label shots that are adult doses, a practice the F.D.A. discouraged on Friday. The agency warned that “children are not small adults,” and that the adult doses now in wide use have not been fully studied for potential safety risks in younger children.\n\nThere’s no question that this summer has been particularly trying for parents, especially after public health experts warned that the Delta variant was highly transmissible — even from vaccinated household members. Although children still are less likely than adults, especially older adults, to be hospitalized or die from Covid, nearly 30,000 children were admitted to hospitals with Covid in August, the highest levels to date during the pandemic.\n\nThe hospitalization rate in mid-August for children and adolescents with confirmed Covid was nearly five times the rate in late June, according to a study released earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate climbed nearly tenfold among children newborn to 4 years old, the report found.\n\nCovid-related emergency room visits and hospital admissions also increased among children in mid-August, according to a second C.D.C. study.\n\nGeography played a role, the researchers found. Those visits and admissions occurred 3.4 and 3.7 times more in the states with lower vaccination rates.\n\nParental anxiety has fueled the demand for slots in children’s vaccine trials and made appointments scarce. Pfizer, for instance, is fully booked in its clinical trial, a spokesperson said.\n\nSo Ms. Vong Reiff most likely nabbed a cancellation slot in Nebraska.Image Logan and Quentin Reiff were given comic book handouts as part of their participation in new vaccine trials.  Credit... Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times  Dr. Tina Sosa, a mother of two, did not have to travel far to get her son vaccinated in a trial. A pediatric hospitalist, Dr. Sosa was on a fellowship at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center when Pfizer began a trial there.\n\nHer older son, Brandon, 3, had no side effects from the two shots he received in April, she said. “I even squeezed his arm and asked did it hurt, and he said no.”\n\nDr. Sosa has since moved to Rochester, N.Y., where she works at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Her 7-month-old son, Leo, is to begin a Moderna trial next month, while Brandon will follow up on his trial in Cincinnati via an app and telephone, Dr. Sosa said.The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest UpdatesUpdated  Nov. 3, 2021, 6:27 p.m. ET   With scant vaccine supplies, the W.H.O. presses Latin America and the Caribbean to hold off on boosters.Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles tests positive for the virus.Biden urges vaccinations for millions of newly eligible children.\n\nIn his push for vaccine mandates on Thursday, President Biden expressed the need to develop vaccines to protect children younger than 12.\n\n“Now if you’re a parent of a young child and you’re wondering when will it be, when will it be — the vaccine — available for them, I strongly support independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12,” he said. “We can’t take shortcuts of that scientific work.”\n\nThe three major U.S. drug companies making vaccines are at different stages when it comes to children’s trials.\n\nPfizer is conducting a single trial for children under 12, Kit Longley, a spokesman, said.\n\nThe trial has included 4,500 children: 3,000 who are 5 to 11; 750 who are 2 to 5; and 750 who are 6 months to 2 years.The company anticipates having its trial data for children ages 5 to 11 later this month, and after more review, potentially will request F.D.A. emergency use authorization for that age group, Mr. Longley said Friday.\n\nModerna announced on Thursday   that the company had finished its enrollment of children ages 6 to 11, totaling 4,000 children, for its trial. The company said it expected to file for F.D.A. emergency-use authorization for that age group by the end of this year.\n\nAnother application should be filed in early 2022, the company said, based on the results of a trial for children 5 and younger. In all, Moderna expected to enroll about 12,000 children, Colleen Hussey, a company spokeswoman, said.\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson has started its Phase 3 clinical trial in adolescents from 12 to 17, and will submit the findings to regulators when finished, according to a company spokesman, Jake Sargent.\n\nThe company is also planning several other studies, he said. One will include children from 6 to 11, followed by children 2 to 5. Another will look at those younger than 2.Image Jennifer and David Macklom with their daughters: Ruth, 2; Naomi, 5; and Miriam, 8. The Mackloms enrolled their two oldest daughters in a Pfizer vaccine trial. Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times  \n\nImpatient parents who are seeking off-label adult shots for their children concern officials like Dr. Sean O’Leary, vice chairman of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics.“It’s a bit of the Wild West out there,” said Dr. O’Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Children’s Hospital Colorado.\n\nJennifer Macklom of Cedar Park, Texas, was determined to get her three daughters enrolled in a trial. Haunting her were the memories of 2016, when her daughter Miriam had grown sick with an adenovirus at age 2 ½. Simultaneously, her daughter Naomi, who was only 6 weeks old at the time, contracted a form of the coronavirus that pre-dated Covid.\n\nMiriam was taken by ambulance to the Dell Children’s Medical Center in Austin. Naomi was admitted through its emergency room.\n\nBoth girls were hooked up on oxygen and feeding tubes at the same time, Ms. Macklom recalled.\n\n“I said, ‘I can’t do that again. I can’t emotionally have anyone I love or even know be hooked up to one of these things,’” said Ms. Macklom, a high school mathematics teacher.\n\nSo, with the advent of the pandemic, she conferred with her pediatrician, and all three children landed on a waiting list for a vaccine trial. Miriam is now 8, Naomi, 5, and Ruth, 2.Image Naomi Macklom playing in an inner tube with her sisters, Ruth, far left, and Miriam, in goggles, in the family&rsquo;s backyard. Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times  \n\nFive months passed. Then the phone rang, and Ms. Macklom learned that her daughters were at the top of the list to receive the Pfizer vaccine at a branch of Austin Regional Clinic, in central Texas.So many parents were interested in that trial for the under-12 age group that the staff had no need to recruit them, according to Heidi Shalev, a clinic spokeswoman.\n\nRuth was too young for vaccinations at that site. Now, to avoid the risk of contracting the virus at day care, she is spending weekdays with Ms. Macklom’s parents.\n\nMiriam and Naomi got their two shots. They don’t know if they contained the vaccine, since this trial called for one-third of shots to be a placebo.

Isopods, however, are \"the most morphologically diverse of all the crustacean groups,\" explained the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThere are estimated to be 10,000 different types of isopods, ranging in size from \"micrometers to a half meter in length.\" About half of isopod species live in the ocean, explained the NOAA, and many, especially small ones, are parasitic&mdash;meaning that they live and feed off of a host creature.\n\nThis particular isopod, discovered near Rausu, a town on Japans northern island of Hokkaido, is unique among its peers, reported Vice. Isopods are typically brown in color, whereas this inch-long specimen is an eye-catching shade of orange-pink.\n\nCombined with the white stripes&mdash;resembling streaks of fat&mdash;along its back and its white belly, the creature looks almost indistinguishable from a piece of salmon nigiri. Only upon closer inspection are the isopods thin legs and black eyes visible.\n\nThe salmon-esque parasite was first caught by fishermen, noted Vice. In July, it was brought to the aquarium Aquamarine Fukushima for display. It remained unknown, however, what animal the isopod had been feeding off of before its capture.\n\nAt the time, the aquarium posted a photo of the acquisition on Twitter, comparing it side-by-side with a traditionally-colored isopod&mdash;and the difference between the two is striking. The post, which can be viewed here, has since gone viral, amassing nearly 29,000 likes and over 13,000 retweets.

On Friday, they opened for the first time in about two months&mdash;and people were thrilled to see the unbelievably cute parasite in action.\n\nSaid Hibino: \"We didnt know how long wed be able to put the animal on display, or if itd even live. But it held out&mdash;it stayed alive for us.\" Salmon sushi served in California, 2019. A parasite, bearing an uncanny resemblance to salmon sushi, was discovered recently in Japan.

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 14, 2021\n\nMGA Entertainment CEO Isaac Larian said today about a recent announcement by the Biden administration, &#8220;Whether the ports are open 24 hours a day or 48 hours a day, you cannot get labor.\n\n&#8220;If you cannot get labor, you cannot get trucks, you cannot get the merchandise out,&#8221; the toymaker executive explained.\n\nLarian added, &#8220;I think this directive is too little, too late. And frankly, it&#8217;s a political gimmick to me.&#8221;\n\nOn Sept. 17, the LA Times wrote about the record number of cargo ships that were anchored or drifting offshore, waiting to enter the L.A. and Long Beach ports to be unloaded.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged during her press briefing yesterday that the White House &#8220;cannot guarantee&#8221; that Christmas presents will arrive on time.\n\nPsaki suggested that the delays might be due to consumer shipping services instead, similar to last year when there was some hiccups with them.\n\n&#8220;We are not the Postal Service, UPS or FedEx. We cannot guarantee. What we can do is use every lever at the federal government’s disposal to reduce delays, to ensure we are addressing bottlenecks in the system, including ports and the need for them to be open longer hours so that goods can arrive. And we continue to press — not only workers and unions — but also companies to take as many steps as they can to reduce these delays,&#8221; Psaki insisted.\n\nOf course, those delays were only for those unwilling to pick their products up at the store. These delays will certainly have greater implications.

Everyone obviously has an opinion on this, and Marbury is no exception.\n\nApparently, Marbury, a Brooklyn native who played for the then-New Jersey Nets for three seasons, did not fact-check his proclamation in support of Irving. Had Marbury invested just two minutes (if not less) in a Google search, he could have found how Muhammad Ali felt about vaccinations. It’s all good though Steph, we got you.

If celebrities, influencers, and athletes like Marbury continue spreading these types of nonfactual propaganda, we’ll never see the end of this pandemic. Too many people are choosing to follow the advice of the internet and NOT doctors and scientists. All Marbury had to do was take a few seconds to check and see if maybe there was any literature or a VIDEO PSA on how Ali felt about vaccinations. I know Marbury has battled mental health issues, but this is irresponsible.\n\nKyrie made his choice to sit out by not being vaccinated  for whatever reason. It’s incredible how so many adults cannot understand how their “personal choice” in this specific case can affect others in an extremely negative way. And the group of people that still thinks this is all some big hoax – come back to reality, please. How many more people need to lose their lives for it to sink in?

During this pandemic, Towns has lost multiple loved ones to COVID-19 .

But that has not stopped multiple prominent figures suggesting a cover up is taking place.

The Hero Pilots at Southwest and other Airlines deserve our support,\" Johnson tweeted while the image of the flag.\n\n\"True patriots worthy of the American Freedom Fighter tradition. Dont Tread On Me. God Bless Them.\"\n\nIt is unclear when or where the photo was taken, if it is actually being flown from a Southwest plane, or who shared it with Johnson. A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told Newsweek that they do not have any comment or information because they also cannot authenticate details about the image. Johnson has been contacted for comment.\n\nThis photo was just sent to me of a grounded Southwest plane flying a Gadsden flag out of the cockpit.

The corrupt corporate media told me this doesnt exist.\"\n\nBernard Kerik, the disgraced New York City police commissioner who obtained a presidential pardon from Donald Trump in 2020, wrote: \"The Southwest Pilots arent just doing this for themselves, but theyre doing it for the entire country and every freedom loving American.\"\n\nThe Gadsden flag, which was designed by Christopher Gadsden during the American Revolution, is used as an anti-establishment symbol in modern times, including being adapted by the Tea Party movement.\n\nMore recently, it has also been prominent at far-right and extremist demonstrations along with the Confederate battle and white-supremacist flags, as well as being widely flown during the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek denying the claims that the disruption was due to pilots and air traffic controllers staging a demonstration against the vaccine mandate, a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said: \"Our operational disruptions over the weekend were not a result of Southwest Employee demonstrations.\n\n\"Bad weather and ATC issues in Florida, a large operation for us, on Friday night created significant flight disruptions throughout our network and we spent the weekend working to recover from the high number of displaced Crews and aircraft.\"\n\nCaptain Casey Murray, president of SWAPA, dismissed the \"false claims\" of a vaccine mandate-related walkout as the reason for the disruptions.\n\n\"I can say with certainty that there are no work slowdowns or sickouts either related to the recent mandatory vaccine mandate or otherwise,\" he said in a statement\n\nThe FAA also stated in a tweet: \"To be clear: None of the information from Southwest, its pilots union, or the FAA indicates that this weekends cancellations were related to vaccine mandates.\"\n\nDespite what officials are saying, Fox News Tucker Carlson also repeated the claim that the canceled flights were due to planned action by pilots on Monday night.\n\n\"The official explanation came right away, it was bad weather on the Eastern Seaboard, there were thunderstorms, there were also unspecified issues with air traffic control and all of that together forced Southwest Airlines to cancel its flights,\" Carlson said.\n\n\"We can tell you it is untrue. All of that is a lie. Its not what happened,\" he added.\n\n\"Weve spoken to several people with direct knowledge of what actually did happen. We can tell you that the shutdown of Southwest Airlines over the weekend was a direct consequence, it was a reaction to, Joe Bidens vaccine mandates.\"\n\nCarlson claimed that some pilots are refusing to take the vaccine because they have immunity from already having the virus, claiming religious exemption, or have expressed concerns about potential side-effects.\n\n\"Yet others are taking a stand purely on principle,  Carlson said. \"They believe that in a free country, politicians should never be allowed to force citizens to submit to medical treatment they dont want.\"\n\nThe speculation about the cancellations arrived as SWAPA stated last week that they would be filing a Temporary Restraining Order in order to stop Southwest Airlines from proceeding with the mandate.

She said her three sources are a Delta Airlines pilot, a Delta Airlines flight attendant who witnessed the event, and a relative of a Delta Airlines employee.\n\nContinuing in her explanation of the events reported to her by the whistleblowing attendant, the deceased pilot was “an LAX based Captain” and the “plane was landed safely” but she is uncertain what explanation, if any, the passengers were given as to why their flight was diverted.\n\nAccording to Ruby, the flight attendant was told by the co-pilot that the now-deceased captain had “completed his second shot” just “several days prior” to the tragic event.  &mdash; Article continues below Petition &mdash;   PETITION: Resist Bidens Vaccine Mandate  &nbsp; Show Petition Text       25237  have signed the petition.Lets get to 30000 !

It&#39;s official: Joe Biden has announced that his Administration will be forcing COVID vaccinations on nearly 1/3rd of American citizens, blatantly disregarding the personal objections of millions of people and moving America ever closer towards a medical dictatorship.\n\nWe cannot stand for this unprecedented overreach, and we will not submit to Biden&#39;s tyrannical public coercion efforts.\n\nPlease SIGN this urgent petition informing the President that you will NOT comply with these unconstitutional vaccine mandate orders issued by the Biden Administration, and that elected officials should act in their capacity to block these intrusive demands.\n\nOn Thursday, September 9th, Joe Biden announced the latest round of federal orders meant to further coerce large swaths of the public into getting the COVID&nbsp;vaccine -- many against their will.\n\nWhile the legal standing of these measures is, at best, dubious, the Biden Administration appears more ready than ever to gut our individual rights and practically erase medical autonomy in our country.\n\nThis latest escalation in overreach was announced via a televised speech in which Biden outlined a new &quot;six-point plan&quot; that includes far more than just six avenues to achieve mass medical compliance.\n\nAmong the most egregious new federal mandates are the following:  A requirement that all private businesses employing more than 100 people mandate their workers get the Covid-19 vaccine or submit to weekly testing (to be implemented by way of a new Department of Labor rule) A requirement that all federal employees and federal contractors get the COVID&nbsp;vaccine A requirement that all healthcare workers in facilities that receive reimbursement from Medicare and/or Medicaid (an estimated 17 million) get the Covid-19 vaccine without an alternative testing option A requirement that all Head Start teachers get the COVID&nbsp;vaccine A federal effort to lobby states to implement vaccine mandates for all school employees, and require regular testing of all students and school staff A federal effort to lobby entertainment venues to require proof of vaccination or testing in order to grant entry to the public A continuation of mask mandates on all federal properties and during interstate travel (i.e. planes, trains, buses)\n\nAll in all, these new vaccine mandates, which will go into effect within the coming weeks, will affect an estimated 100 million American workers -- 2/3rds of the entire workforce!\n\nAnd, according to an administration official, violations of these unconstitutional requirements could result in fines of up to $14,000.\n\nWhile this is clearly a political ploy on the part of the Joe Biden and his team of power-hungry Washington insiders to shift the focus from their disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the American public knows better: After nearly a year and a half&#39;s worth of arbitrary, ever-changing, and unconstitutional government mandates in response to the COVID outbreak, it was always a given that the Biden Administration would ramp things up even further when it behooved them.\n\nAnd now, it would seem that time has officially come.\n\n&quot;This is not about freedom or personal choice,&quot; Biden uttered in his remarks, confirming his administration&#39;s blatant dismissal of all Americans&#39; right(s) to accept or decline the experimental Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThis is a stunning reversal from Biden&#39;s declaration last December that &quot;I don&rsquo;t think [the vaccine] should be mandatory, I wouldn&rsquo;t demand it to be mandatory.&quot;\n\nIn fact, Biden even confirmed his intention to flout states&#39; rights in the process, warning that &quot;If these governors won&rsquo;t help us beat the pandemic I&rsquo;ll use my power as president to get them out of the way.&quot;\n\nThese are not the words of an &quot;empathetic&quot;&nbsp;leader; these are the words of an aspiring dictator. And, for the time being, the only way to stop Joe Biden&#39;s tyranny is through mass noncompliance.\n\nAs we&#39;ve said from the beginning, science, basic logic, and common sense should dictate policy regarding COVID&nbsp;and the Delta variant.\n\nBut Joe Biden and the federal government have long abandoned those principles throughout this crisis, culminating into this disturbing yet inevitable flurry of intrusive vaccine mandates that use people&#39;s jobs, individual autonomy, and livelihood as leverage.\n\nThis assault on our individual rights, private businesses, and American workers cannot be tolerated, and the easiest way to combat these unlawful orders is to just say NO.\n\nPlease SIGN and SHARE this most important petition letting Joe Biden know that you will NOT comply with the unconstitutional medical demands being made by this administration, and that action should be taken to block any intrusive action against working Americans and private employers.\n\nThank you!\r\n \r\n FOR MORE INFORMATION:\r\n \r\n &#39;Biden announces vaccine requirements for private businesses, impacting tens of millions of Americans&#39;: https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/breaking-biden-announces-vaccine-requirements-for-private-businesses-impacting-tens-of-millions-of-workers/     &nbsp; Hide Petition Text   Sign this Petition\n\nDelta Airlines has since come out denying the incident ever took place, and according to USA TODAY stated that “the coronavirus vaccines do not cause death.”\n\nContrasting Delta’s claim that the “vaccines do not cause death” is the European Union’s official data, the World Health Organization&#8217;s data (WHO), and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database co-run by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe WHO’s database lists 2.1 million adverse effect reports related to the injections, while the European Union’s data shows over 2 million injuries and at least 21,000 deaths in EU countries alone.\n\nVAERS in America currently reports a whopping 16,000 dead Americans, with the sworn testimony of whistleblowers claiming VAERS suffers from severe underreporting and the more accurate number is a “conservative estimate” of 45,000 deaths.\n\nRuby added that this is just one of many suspicious events that has occurred since vaccine mandates for airlines have become almost ubiquitous, alleging that the mid-flight death is not an anomaly, but part of a larger crisis that is “much bigger than people think.”\n\nRuby mentioned a Seattle-based pilot who was found dead from an embolism, two Atlanta-based flight attendants were found dead in their homes, one Salt Lake City pilot who suffered a breakthrough infection and died of kidney failure after being put on remdesivir, and a 47-year-old Salt Lake City flight attendant “base manager” who died suddenly.\n\nAlthough Delta Airlines has not explicitly mandated the vaccine, the company did announce a vaccination program that requires unvaccinated employees to pay a $200 monthly surcharge if they are covered by the company’s healthcare plan. This plan has led to a reported vaccination rate of over 90 percent companywide.\n\nThe institution of mandatory or coercive COVID-19 injection policies in the workplace has been a cause for concern in the medical community and the legal community alike.\n\nJust last month, Dr. Peter McCullough along with more than two dozen top doctors and scientists, filed a lawsuit against the FDA to obtain the “data and information” the agency used to approve the use of the Pfizer shot despite the widespread concerns surrounding their safety and efficacy.\n\nLawyer Aaron Siri penned an article outlining the necessity of the lawsuit in light of the increased prevalence of vaccine mandates and vaccine coercion policies nationwide.\n\n“Transparency demands the FDA immediately disclose the data it relied upon to license the Pfizer vaccine. Not tomorrow. Today,” wrote the lawyer. “Scientists, health care professionals, and every person in this country, especially those mandated to receive this product, should have access to the data now.”\n\n“The CDC and FDA hold all the data. You don’t. They hold all the data. Where’s the report card? They work for us. Demand it,” said Dr. McCullough, a world-renowned cardiologist and expert on the early treatment of COVID-19. “Every time you’re confronted with this, ‘Oh, my employer wants me to take a vaccine.’ [Ask] ‘Where’s the report card from the CDC and FDA?’ Demand a report card.

You can see the progression of the cells as the appear normal in the initial image. Nine days later they are observed to be jagged in appearance, irregular, and beginning to coagulate. A week after that, there is very increased coagulation.\n\nNote: Ignore the dates on the images. They do not correlate to the dates of the microscopic examinations of the cells, which were captured in November and early December.     Initial Microscopic View of Red Blood Cells    9 Days after mRNA injection    16 days after mRNA injection\n\nAfter posting this information, I researched possible reasons for the jagged  appearance of blood cells. I came across articles that describe them as  schisocytes, known as fragmented blood cells. They can be the result of the cells moving through obstructions in small blood vessels. I believe it&#8217;s plausible that since the spike proteins sit on the outer portion of the cell &#8211; to include vessel walls &#8211; that the arrival of antibodies and macrophages could obstruct the normal blood flow and create damage to the blood cells. This could also result in the clotting that we&#8217;re seeing. Here are additional details about schisocytes.

This needs follow up after 4 months to see if new blood cells continue to exhibit the deformation or if it&#8217;s a one time event that only affects cells present in blood stream at the time of the vaccine. And some research needs to be done on spread of the lipid particles to see if they persist in the body over time or eventually get purged.

I really don&#8217;t care about the date stamp on the picture of three different individuals. why isn&#8217;t this on the news. Its an experimental vaccine so lets study it! No doubt thousands are dead within 14 days of being vaccinated.\r\n The public that trust this medical system and sees massive deaths from screwing up our DNA is going to be mad as hell when they figure out who lied to them, who promoted the lie and who profited from the lie.

Given that this is alarming considering that this is after the M-RNA shot. blood should not look like that ever. 				  				Reply			 		   		 			 				 					 												Steve Walton says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 11:56 am					  									  				Why does the video timestamp go from 5/11/21 to 5/05/21, and why are the color gammas so different on the last two (implying different instrument)? And, &#8220;a clinic&#8221; isn&#8217;t very specific.\n\nThough I might believe this series of events, this report shows no evidence of vetting, despite the headline. There is little to no evidence in the images themselves that these represent a progression in a single patient.

They are from November and December. You have every right to be skeptical. Clinics aren&#8217;t going to publicly release information like this in our current environment of cancelling everyone. Consider this though &#8211; the images are consistent with the effects we&#8217;re seeing &#8211; blood clots, strokes, migraines, heart inflammation, menstrual issues, brain fog. I believe them to be authentic for that reason, and Sarah does ethical reporting. I have no reason not to trust her.

I just wish the &#8220;date issue&#8221; was addressed in the initial post. Looking at the frames, the &#8220;date stamp&#8221; appears to come from the lab. Obviously, the &#8220;pro vaccine&#8221; mob would jump on this as proof of misinformation. 				  				Reply			 		 		 			 				 					 												Lynne says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 1:24 pm					  									  				Yes, I understand it can be misleading. I trust Sarah though and don&#8217;t believe she would publish photoshopped images. There&#8217;s very little to gain. It&#8217;s very concerning because we know people are experiencing severe blood related issues following the shots. My heart sinks when someone close to me tells me they got them.\n\nEdited to add: I researched reasons for this appearance of jagged cells and I will edit my blog post to include it. It&#8217;s caused by them being torn/damaged by difficulty moving through small vessels easily. I suspect spike proteins are causing obstructions.

Reply			 		   		 			 				 					 												Keith says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 7:41 pm					  									  				\n\nWhile the two dates may be suspect, it appears that the three images were taken by a camera or phone-cam, on different parts of the display screen.  As if I pulled up an image on the internet (or somewhere) and took a photo of my monitor with my phone.  The date fonts look exactly the same, but the camera was positioned differently in each one.  The color discrepancies look to be the result of the monitor the original images are displayed on.  If you notice the first one had a reddish tint, the second more greenish, and the third seems to have both, making it seem like the edges of the display have a problem, maybe with angle of view.  It&#8217;s possible the person taking the images took the &#8220;after&#8221; one first, and then realized they needed the &#8220;before&#8221; to compare it to, thereby leading to the date differences.  This doesn&#8217;t tell us when or where the three images were initially rendered (that is the microscope or lab or whatever).

The patient said that he noticed a small amount of blood in his stool one day but nothing remotely like the 50% blood loss. He causally mentioned that he had just had his second jab a couple of weeks ago and it knocked him on his ass. The three doctors in the room made no connection or comment linking it to his life threatening problem. On top of that his body was not creating any new blood to replace what he lost. He had a somewhat of a rare blood type and the hospital was only able to give him 2 transfusions. It didn’t help him at all, he was in for about a week and after a bunch of tests, they sent him home and gave him a prescription for iron pills. ‘He was still in the same shape as when he came in.  They also said if it happened to him again, he’d be dead..

He was determined to find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia, but he never did. Instead, he stumbled upon the Americas. Though he did not really &#x201C;discover&#x201D; the so-called New World&#x2014;millions of people already lived there&#x2014;his journeys marked the beginning of centuries of&#xA0;exploration and colonization of North and South America.\n\nWATCH: Columbus: The Lost Voyage on HISTORY VaultChristopher Columbus and the Age of DiscoveryRecommended for you1959Montreal&apos;s Jacques Plante becomes first NHL goaltender to wear facemask1964Minnesota Vikings&apos; Jim Marshall runs wrong way with recovered fumble2016Chicago Cubs win first World Series title since 1908, snap &apos;curse&apos;\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, leaders of several European nations sponsored expeditions abroad in the hope that explorers would find great wealth and vast undiscovered lands. The Portuguese were the earliest participants in this &#x201C;Age of Discovery,&#x201D; also known as &#x201C;Age of Exploration.&#x201D;\n\nStarting in about 1420, small Portuguese ships known as caravels zipped along the African coast, carrying spices, gold and other goods as well as enslaved people from Asia and Africa to Europe.\n\nDid you know? Christopher Columbus was not the first person to propose that a person could reach Asia by sailing west from Europe. In fact, scholars argue that the idea is almost as old as the idea that the Earth is round. (That is, it dates back to early Rome.)\n\nOther European nations, particularly Spain, were eager to share in the seemingly limitless riches of the &#x201C;Far East.&#x201D; By the end of the 15th century, Spain&#x2019;s &#x201C;Reconquista&#x201D;&#x2014;the expulsion of Jews and Muslims out of the kingdom after centuries of war&#x2014;was complete, and the nation turned its attention to exploration and conquest in other areas of the world.\n\nREAD MORE: Exploration of North America: The Essential Facts&#xA0;Christopher Columbus: Early Life\n\nChristopher Columbus, the son of a wool merchant, is believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy, in 1451. When he was still a teenager, he got a job on a merchant ship. He remained at sea until 1476, when pirates attacked his ship as it sailed north along the Portuguese coast.\n\nThe boat sank, but the young Columbus floated to shore on a scrap of wood and made his way to Lisbon, where he eventually studied mathematics, astronomy, cartography and navigation. He also began to hatch the plan that would change the world forever.The First Voyage\n\nAt the end of the 15th century, it was nearly impossible to reach Asia from Europe by land. The route was long and arduous, and encounters with hostile armies were difficult to avoid. Portuguese explorers solved this problem by taking to the sea: They sailed south along the West African coast and around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nBut Columbus had a different idea: Why not sail west across the Atlantic instead of around the massive African continent? The young navigator&#x2019;s logic was sound, but his math was faulty. He argued (incorrectly) that the circumference of the Earth was much smaller than his contemporaries believed it was; accordingly, he believed that the journey by boat from Europe to Asia should be not only possible, but comparatively easy via an as-yet undiscovered Northwest Passage.&#xA0;\n\nHe presented his plan to officials in Portugal and England, but it was not until 1492 that he found a sympathetic audience: the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile.\n\nColumbus wanted fame and fortune. Ferdinand and Isabella wanted the same, along with the opportunity to export Catholicism to lands across the globe. (Columbus, a devout Catholic, was equally enthusiastic about this possibility.)\n\nColumbus&#x2019; contract with the Spanish rulers promised that he could keep 10 percent of whatever riches he found, along with a noble title and the governorship of any lands he should encounter.Christopher Columbus&apos; Ships: Ni&#xF1;a, Pinta and Santa Maria\n\n            On August 3, 1492, Columbus and his crew set sail from Spain in three ships: the Ni&#xF1;a, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. On October 12, the ships made landfall&#x2014;not in the East Indies, as Columbus assumed, but on one of the Bahamian islands, likely San Salvador.\n\nFor months, Columbus sailed from island to island in what we now know as the Caribbean, looking for the &#x201C;pearls, precious stones, gold, silver, spices, and other objects and merchandise whatsoever&#x201D; that he had promised to his Spanish patrons, but he did not find much. In January 1493, leaving several dozen men behind in a makeshift settlement on Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic), he left for Spain.\n\nHe kept a detailed diary during his first voyage. Christopher Columbus&#x2019;s journal was written between August 3, 1492, and November 6, 1492 and mentions everything from the wildlife he encountered, like dolphins and birds, to the weather to the moods of his crew. More troublingly, it also recorded his initial impressions of the local people and his argument for why they should be enslaved.\n\n&#x201C;They &#x2026; brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks&#x2019; bells,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They willingly traded everything they owned &#x2026; They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features &#x2026;They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron &#x2026;They would make fine servants &#x2026; With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.&#x201D;\n\nColumbus gifted the journal to Isabella upon his return.\n\nREAD MORE: The Ships of Christopher Columbus Were Sleek, Fast&#x2014;and CrampedChristopher Columbus&apos;s Later Voyages\n\nAbout six months later, in September 1493, Columbus returned to the Americas. He found the Hispaniola settlement destroyed and left his brothers Bartolomeo and Diego Columbus behind to rebuild, along with part of his ships&#x2019; crew and hundreds of enslaved indigenous people.\n\nThen he headed west to continue his mostly fruitless search for gold and other goods. His group now included a large number of indigenous people the Europeans had enslaved. In lieu of the material riches he had promised the Spanish monarchs, he sent some 500 enslaved people to Queen Isabella. The queen was horrified&#x2014;she believed that any people Columbus &#x201C;discovered&#x201D; were Spanish subjects who could not be enslaved&#x2014;and she promptly and sternly returned the explorer&#x2019;s gift.\n\nIn May 1498, Columbus sailed west across the Atlantic for the third time. He visited Trinidad and the South American mainland before returning to the ill-fated Hispaniola settlement, where the colonists had staged a bloody revolt against the Columbus brothers&#x2019; mismanagement and brutality. Conditions were so bad that Spanish authorities had to send a new governor to take over. Meanwhile, the native Taino population, forced to search for gold and to work on plantations, was decimated (within 60 years after Columbus landed, only a few hundred of what may have been 250,000 Taino were left on their island). Christopher Columbus was arrested and returned to Spain in chains.&#xA0;\n\nIn 1502, cleared of the most serious charges but stripped of his noble titles, the aging Columbus persuaded the Spanish crown to pay for one last trip across the Atlantic. This time, Columbus made it all the way to Panama&#x2014;just miles from the Pacific Ocean&#x2014;where he had to abandon two of his four ships after damage from storms and hostile natives. Empty-handed, the explorer returned to Spain, where he died in 1506.Legacy of Christopher Columbus\n\nChristopher Columbus did not &#x201C;discover&#x201D; the Americas, nor was he even the first European to visit the &#x201C;New World.&#x201D; (Viking explorer Leif Erikson had sailed to Greenland and Newfoundland in the 11th century.)\n\nHowever, his journey kicked off centuries of exploration and exploitation on the American continents. The Columbian Exchange transferred people, animals, food and disease across cultures. Old World wheat became an American food staple. African coffee and Asian sugar cane became cash crops for Latin America, while American foods like corn, tomatoes and potatoes were introduced into European diets.&#xA0;\n\nToday, Columbus has a controversial legacy&#x2014;he is remembered as a daring and path-breaking explorer who transformed the New World, yet his actions also unleashed changes that would eventually devastate the native populations he and his fellow explorers encountered.\n\nREAD MORE: Christopher Columbus: How The Explorer&apos;s Legend Grew&#x2014;and Then Drew Fire Citation InformationArticle Title\n\nChristopher Columbus Author\n\nHistory.com Editors Website Name\n\nHISTORYURL\n\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbusAccess Date\n\nPublisher\n\nA&amp;E Television NetworksLast Updated\n\nOctober 4, 2021Original Published Date\n\nNovember 9, 2009Tagsterms:ExplorersBy History.com Editors    \n\nFACT CHECK:   We strive for accuracy and fairness.

Whenever my family did cook we always gave thanks that all the Native Americans werent wiped out when Columbus \"discovered\" America. I never understood why my family was so against Thanksgiving. In school we drew turkeys with our hands and it was a happy time. It meant a couple of days off from school. My teachers made it seem like Thanksgiving was a holiday to look forward to. The New York City public education system told me what Thanksgiving was all about. I was very careful to regurgitate what they taught me when tested so I wouldnt get a failing grade. When I was older though I was told the truth by my family. \n\nMy great, great, great, great grandfather was a part of a band of Black Indians in Florida, hence my unique and Native American-sounding last name. It seems I come from a long line of warriors and activists. I am a revolutionary not by choice but by lineage. When I did finally learn, there was no stopping me. Whenever someone asked what I was doing for Thanksgiving I proudly stated that I no longer celebrate it. Thanksgiving day should be known as National Land Theft and American Genocide Day. Advertisement    \n\nI learned that in 1637 the body of a white man was discovered dead in a boat. Armed settlers -- which we tell our children were God fearing, gentle, sharing, kind Pilgrims -- invaded a Pequot village. They also set the village, which included many children, on fire. Those who were lucky enough to escape the fire were systematically sought, hunted down and killed. While many, including historians, still debate what exactly happened this day, also known as the Pequot Massacre, it directly led to the creation of \"Thanksgiving Day.\" This is what the governor of Bay Colony had to say days after the massacre, \"A day of thanksgiving. Thanking God that they had eliminated over 700 men, women and children.\"\n\nWilliam B. Newell, a Penobscot Indian and former chairman of the Anthropology Department at the University of Connecticut stated, \"Gathered in this place of meeting, they were attacked by mercenaries and English and Dutch. The Indians were ordered from the building and as they came forth were shot down, The rest were burned alive in the building. The very next day the governor declared a Thanksgiving Day. For the next 100 years, every Thanksgiving Day ordained by a Governor was in honor of the bloody victory, thanking God that the battle had been won.\" \n\nWhen I finally found out the origins of Thanksgiving it made me nauseous. Never again will I celebrate a holiday I know nothing about until I investigate its origins. I am very thankful, pun intended, that I learned about the origins of this holiday. It is a reminder that history can be rewritten and if told enough times eventually becomes the truth!\n\nPeople always tell me to forget the past. I should just let it go and move on. Why do people of color always have to forget?! Would you tell a Jewish person to forget about the holocaust and just move on?! Would you tell the family of those who lost their lives on 9/11 to just forget about it?! So why are our tragedies forgettable and others are not?! I WILL NEVER forget! I will ALWAYS honor those who lost their lives unjustifiable. \n\nSo when you sit down to dinner this year, look at your family, serve the food and tell each other what you are most thankful for, think about the origins of Thanksgiving. Think about the countless Native Americans who lost their lives so you can carve a turkey and get the best deals on Black Friday. Say a prayer for them, especially the children, who died simply because of the color of their skin.Nicole Breedlove, Contributor\n\nCustomer Service Racial BiasSuggest a correctionMore: black voicesNative AmericansLesbianafrican americansblacks    TrendingBritney Spears Blames Mother For ConservatorshipProsecutor: Ruggs Driving Over 150 MPH Before Fatal CrashTrump May Be About To Learn That Being Ex-President Doesn’t Carry Much Weight In CourtBraves Fans Celebrate World Series Win With Racist Cheer That Won&#x27;t Go AwayTwo Democratic Senators Vote Against Rahm Emanuel For AmbassadorNewsletter Sign UpBlack VoicesAmplifying Black voices through news that matters.Successfully Subscribed!Stories that matter delivered to your inbox        Whats HotResearch Suggests Extensive COVID-19 Infections In White-Tailed DeerAaron Rodgers Tests Positive For COVID-19 Amid Reports That He&#x27;s UnvaccinatedMacaulay Culkin Is Now A Gucci Model And Completely At Home On The RunwaySupreme Court Poised To Strike Down Restrictive New York Gun LawMore In Black VoicesAt Least 8 Republicans Who Were At The Jan. 6 Rally Just Got Elected To OfficeHigh School Football Team Beats Rival So Badly Principal ApologizesJay-Z Joins Instagram, Becomes The Only Person Beyoncé FollowsBring It To The Table: Will Smith Says He &#x27;Fell In Love&#x27; With Stockard Channing On Set    NEWSPOLITICSENTERTAINMENTLIFECOMMUNITIESHUFFPOST PERSONALVIDEONEWSLETTERSHuffPostAbout UsAdvertiseContact UsRSSFAQCareersArchiveUser AgreementComment PolicyHuffPost Press RoomPrivacy PolicyDMCA PolicyConsent PreferencesPart of HuffPost Black Voices. ©2021 BuzzFeed, Inc.

scene from a sci-fi disaster movie. The agency announced Sunday that its sending spacecraft above the Earth to crash into an asteroids moonlet to change the bodys trajectory.&nbsp;\n\nThe mission, a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), will be the first agencys use of the kinetic impactor technique, in which a large, high-speed spacecraft is sent into an asteroids path to change its motion. NASA is set to conduct the mission, what it calls \"the first test for planetary defense,\" on November 24, the day before Thanksgiving, to hit the binary near-Earth asteroid Didymos and its moonlet, Dimorphos.&nbsp;     &#9732;&#65039; #PlanetaryDefense at @NASA entails finding, tracking, and characterizing near-Earth #asteroids and objects. Here&rsquo;s what weve found thus far. Our #DARTMission, launching this November, will also be our first test for planetary defense.\n\nLearn more at https://t.co/1wL4ifObpp pic.twitter.com/8JryeeWQjG&mdash; NASA Asteroid Watch (@AsteroidWatch) October 1, 2021\n\nThe asteroid is roughly 780 meters across &mdash; about 2,559 feet, according to NASA. Its moonlet is about 525 feet, which according to NASA, is \"more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose the most likely significant threat to Earth.\"&nbsp;\n\nThe DART spacecraft will crash into the moonlet nearly head-on at about 6.6 kilometers per second, a speed thats faster than a bullet and rapid enough to change the speed of the moonlet by a fraction of 1%, NASA says. Though it appears like a small change, this impact will change the orbital period of the moonlet by several minutes.&nbsp;\n\nDART will be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, but its not going to crash into the asteroids moon for another 10 months. NASA said that it will be cruising in space until September 2022, when the Didymos system is within 11 million kilometers of Earth.&nbsp;     \n\nThe #DARTmission is @NASA&rsquo;s first #PlanetaryDefense test mission and will impact an asteroid to demonstrate a technique that could be used in the future to protect Earth from a potential impact. #CountdownToLaunch on November 24!

While the basic idea to the movie is similar, however, NASA has said that neither Didymos nor Dimorphos pose a threat to Earth. This particular mission, the agency says, is so that scientists can calculate how effective DART missions can be.&nbsp;\n\nThe distance from Earth that the asteroid and its moonlet will be at the time of the collision is close enough that telescopes will be able to observe what happens.&nbsp;                               Space &amp; Astronomy                                 More                                                                                                                                                                SpaceX Crew Dragon launch delayed by \"minor medical issue\"                                                                                                                                                                    Northern Lights could be visible in parts of the U.S. Saturday night                                                                                                                                                                    New phase of water, known as \"superionic ice,\" discovered inside planets                                                                                                                                                                    Blue Origin unveils plans for commercial space station                                                                                                                                                                    New infant planet discovered by researchers in Hawaii                                                                                  More                             Li Cohen                                                        \n\nLi Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News, focusing on social justice issues.

Emails from Pfizer executives leaked to Project Veritas confirm that the company is using human embryonic kidney cells in its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine testing program. (Image: JOHN THYS/AFP via Getty Images)     A new Pfizer whistleblower has come forward with copies of an email chain involving two high level company executives confirming that cell lines that derive from an aborted fetus have been used in the company’s COVID-19 vaccine testing program.\n\nIn an Oct. 6 piece published by Project Veritas,  Melissa Strickler, a Quality Auditor who worked in Pfizer’s McPherson, Kansas plant, leaked emails from Vanessa Gelman, Senior Director of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical Communication and Philip Dormitzer, Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Viral Vaccines showing the officers confirming human embryonic kidney cells are used in the company’s testing program.\n\nRead More: Trio of Pfizer Scientists Expose Corporate Culture, Virtues of Natural ImmunityHHS Whistleblower Alleges COVID Vaccine Side Effects Common, UnderreportedOn Hidden Camera, FDA Employee Says Blow Darts Should Be Used to Force Vaccinate Blacks, Low IQ WhitesUndercover Video Shows J&amp;J Scientist Calling for ‘Second Grade Citizens’ Through Vaccine Passports\n\nStrickler claims to have accidentally discovered the emails in an internal Pfizer database.\n\nFetal tissue confirmed in laboratory testing\n\nIn an email dated February 4, 2021, Gelman was asked by Advait Badkar, who is listed as a “Senior Director” on his LinkedIn profile, “This question came in as an enquiry to our Med Info group…’Did Pfizer make use of a cell line from an aborted foetus when carrying out any confirmatory tests for this vaccine?’”\n\nBadkar added, “This is AFTER we had already confirmed with the customer that no cell lines from an aborted foetus were used in the manufacturing process of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.”\n\nGelman responded, “We have been trying as much as possible not to mention the fetal cell lines,” providing an additional paragraph that was half in red, and half in yellow. The piece in yellow, Gelman said, “We have tried really hard not to share unless it’s strictly necessary and mission critical.”\n\nThe red portion was consistent with Badkar’s original email, “Human fetal derived cell lines are not used to produce our investigational vaccine, which consists of synthetic and enzymatically produced components.”\n\nBut the yellow portion contained the admission, “One or more cell lines with an origin that can be traced back to human fetal tissue has been used in laboratory tests associated with the vaccine program.” Email exchange from Vanessa Gelman, Pfizer Director of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical Communication admitting human embryonic cells are used in the company’s vaccine development program. (Image: Screenshot via YouTube Video)\n\nLater in the email chain, a second Pfizer executive, Philip Dormitzer, Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Viral Vaccines, confirmed, “HEK293T [Human Embryonic Kidney] cells, used for the IVE assay, are ultimately derived from an aborted fetus.”&nbsp;\n\n“On the other had, the Vatican doctrinal committee has confirmed that they consider it acceptable for Pro-Life believers to be immunized.”\n\nDormitzer added, “Pfizer’s official statement couches the answer well and is what should be provided in response to an outside inquiry.”\n\nThe next day on Feb. 5, Gelman followed up in the chain, wanting to confirm with Badkar and several other staffers where the request originated in order to insure it was not from a “member of the public,” because Gelman “just want[ed] to make sure we are responding to a legitimate request that may ignite a FB campaign on this that we may ultimately need to manage.”\n\nOn Feb. 9, Gelman reiterated to the now-dozen Pfizer employees who have been brought into the email chain that the information on aborted babies being used in vaccine testing was extremely sensitive to Pfizer’s public relations, “From the perspective of corporate affairs, we want to avoid having the information on the fetal cells floating out there.”\n\n“In this heated environment of heightened scrutiny on every detail on our vaccine, we would like to avoid the opportunity of creating an issue &#8211; we believe that the risk of communicating this right now outweighs any potential benefit we could see, particularly with members of the general public who may take this information and use it in ways we may not want it out there.”\n\n“We have not received any questions from policy makers or media on this issue in the last few weeks, so we want to avoid raising this, if possible.” A blackout\n\nIn a second case provided by the whistleblower, she filmed an instance where windows in “manufacturing rooms” and “group lead offices” inside the Kansas plant had been blacked out, allegedly in advance of a visit by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n“I could not believe that they were blacking out windows down in our manufacturing rooms,” said Strickler.\n\n“They tell us, you know, that you should make sure you can be seen at all times for integrity purposes&#8230;and so when I saw they were blacking out windows in group lead offices and unoccupied fill rooms, I thought it was odd.”\n\nStrickler says she raised the issue with a member of Pfizer’s Aseptic Quality department and was told, “Well, the FDA is coming.” The light of conscience\n\nProject Veritas frontman James O’Keefe asked Strickler why she stepped forward, “I felt it was the right thing to do. I feel like I had no one else to turn to within my own company who would be honest with me.”\n\n“What was troubling to me was they were wanting to keep it under wraps. They didn’t really want the information out there that they were using the HEK [Human Embryonic Kidney] cells to do the study.”\n\nWhen asked why she thought Pfizer was trying to cover up the use of fetal tissue in experiments, Strickler said she is of the opinion that it was all about not letting religious reasons be used for mandatory vaccination exemptions, “They don’t want to stir up a mess. They don’t want to have to deal with people who are upset, because I think people can use religious exemptions for it, and they don’t want that.”&nbsp;\n\n“I think they want nobody to have an excuse to not get it&#8230;And they’re denying our religious exemptions at Pfizer.”\n\nShe continued, “It shouldn’t be political, but they’re making it political. The media and the government is making it political. But this isn’t about Republican, Democrat, liberal, or conservative. This is informed consent on injecting something inside of you from a company that’s called it an experimental vaccine.”&nbsp;\n\n“This is about when you see something that’s being done that you don’t think is right and exposing it.”\n\nO’Keefe asked the woman whether she was afraid of retaliation for stepping forward. In response, she said what she was most concerned about was the coming wave of mandatory injections for children, “A little bit. I have faith that I will be protected or whatever the outcome is is what it’s supposed to be. I’m at peace with it. I’m a little anxious on what they’ll do or what they’ll say, but it needs to be seen by the people because they’re trying to get this to kids.”\n\n“And if they’re being this deceptive about it, I don’t feel comfortable being silent while they’re trying to give it to babies who can’t talk.”\n\nIn closing, Strickler had a message for her soon-to-be former employer, “You guys are very adamant about integrity and making sure that things are done right and that things are always double checked. But I’m just one person, one face of many of your employees who are willing to fight this and reveal to the world what’s going on.”&nbsp;\n\n“And all we want is for you to be transparent and honest with us and do the right thing.”    Neil Campbell\n\nNeil lives in Canada and writes about society and politics.\n\n  View all posts                  RELATED NEWS   Republican Glenn Youngkin Wins Virginia Governor Race           Austin Rejects Proposal to Hire More Police Officers, Musk Warns City Against Copying San Francisco           Pricier Thanksgiving Turkey This Year, Warns Butterball CEO           Another 150 People Apprehended as DOJ Probe Tackles Dark Web Opioid Trade                   TOP STORIES  Leaked Pfizer Executive Emails Confirm Aborted Fetal Tissue Used in COVID Vaccine Testing           Trio of Pfizer Scientists Expose Surveillance and Profit-driven Corporate Culture, Virtues of Natural           Twitter Labels Obituary of 37-Year-Old Seattle Mother Who Died From COVID Vaccine Blood Clots ‘Misleading           ‘No Discernable Relationship’ Between Vaccination Rate and New COVID-19 Cases Across 68 Countries: Study           Experiment Finds Pfizer Vaccine Desaturates and Clots Red Blood Cells, Contains ‘Garbage’ Crystalline              MOST POPULAR  Leaked Pfizer Executive Emails Confirm Aborted Fetal Tissue Used in COVID Vaccine Testing           Trio of Pfizer Scientists Expose Surveillance and Profit-driven Corporate Culture, Virtues of Natural           Twitter Labels Obituary of 37-Year-Old Seattle Mother Who Died From COVID Vaccine Blood Clots ‘Misleading           Iceland Halts use of Moderna Vaccine for all Ages Citing Health Concerns           ‘No Discernable Relationship’ Between Vaccination Rate and New COVID-19 Cases Across 68 Countries: Study           US Attorneys Preparing Argument That Natural Immunity Is Valid Exemption from Vaccine Mandate              LOAD MORE              EDITIONS   Chinese   Spanish   French   Italian   Japanese     COMPANY   About   Contact   Advertise   Submissions     INFO   Privacy Policy   Terms of Service   Copyright Policy and Infringement Notification     POPULAR CATEGORY   US   China   World   Politics   Human Rights       About Us Vision Times tells the world everything about China in todays context.

Henson, a singer and songwriter, produced and performed the emotional track in a music video that a 14-year-old Gabby and her stepbrothers Joseph and Derek Petito also appeared in.

No one knows the way that I feel, the depth of being alone,&quot; the ballad begins. The footage follows an adult woman walking alone on a beach, remembering visions of a young son she lost, alluding to an unseen school shooting after scenes of a busy morning and drop-off. \n\nLater in the clip, other children hold up signs with messages like &quot;I deserve a future,&quot; &quot;No more violence against kids&quot; and &quot;Protect us.&quot; Then, a teenage Petito makes a cameo, lounging in the grass with a notepad and later holding up a sign reading &quot;I&apos;m irreplaceable.&quot;      Gabby Petito in music video        Credit: Irreplaceable/Youtube \n\nRELATED: Woman Who Drove Hitchhiking Brian Laundrie Noticed &apos;Nothing Extraordinary&apos;&#xA0; &#x2014; Until They Got Near Van    \n\nReflecting on production, Henson told PEOPLE the video was shot over a picture-perfect weekend in Long Island and that the lyrics hit harder than ever in the wake of Petito&apos;s death at age 22. \n\n&quot;Watching the video now truly breaks my heart, and has had a profound effect on me. It&apos;s hard to comprehend how and why [she died],&quot; Henson says. &quot;I haven&apos;t stopped thinking about Gabby since I found out.&quot;       \n\nWhile filming the video with the Petito kids and other children from the neighborhood, the singer said that Gabby lifted everyone&apos;s spirits with her bright personality. \n\n&quot;Working with Gabby was awesome. She was just a sweet girl who wanted to help and be involved,&quot; Henson says. &quot;She was full of love for everyone. I think that&apos;s why this story has resonated. You can feel her love for life.&quot;  \n\n&quot;It&apos;s profound and ironic that she was in this specific video,&quot; she continues. &quot;Her family are good people and don&apos;t deserve such agony and tragedy, no one does. I know her family will find the positive eventually and do great things in the name of Gabby.&quot;     Gabby Petito        Credit: Joseph Petito Twitter \n\nNow, Henson has rededicated the song in the young woman&apos;s honor, and pledged to donate all proceeds from downloads of &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; to the Gabby Petito Foundation.&#xA0;  \n\nOn Sept. 19, authorities announced that the body found in Grand Teton National Park over the weekend has been positively identified as Gabby, who was&#xA0;last heard from in late August&#xA0;during a cross-country road trip with her fianc&#xE9;, Brian Laundrie. \n\nAccording to a tweet by the&#xA0;FBI&apos;s Denver field office, Petito died by homicide. Authorities have not released a cause of death, but named Laundrie as a person of interest.  \n\nRELATED: Gabby Petito&apos;s Father Asks Supporters to Be &apos;Inspired&apos; at Funeral Held for N.Y.

Maria Gonzalez died last month of Covid-19. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times  The tally of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. has surpassed 100,000.\n\nJust over four months after the government confirmed the first known case, more than 100,000 people who had the coronavirus have died in the United States, according to a New York Times tally.\n\nThe death toll is far higher than in any other nation in the world.\n\nThe toll exceeds the number of U.S. military combat fatalities in every conflict since the Korean War. It matches the toll in the United States of the 1968 flu pandemic, and it is approaching the 116,000 killed in another flu outbreak a decade before that.The pandemic is on track to be the country’s deadliest public health disaster since the 1918 flu pandemic, in which about 675,000 Americans died.\n\nAs the nation neared the milestone, President Trump flew to Florida on Wednesday in the hopes of watching the first launch of NASA astronauts into orbit from the United States in nearly a decade. But threatening weather led the launch to be postponed until Saturday at the earliest.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, released a video on Wednesday in which he expressed grief and charged that “this is a fateful milestone we should have never reached.” He faulted the administration for not enacting social-distancing measures sooner, which researchers said would have saved thousands of lives.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump had taken aim on Twitter at those who would question his response. “The Radical Left Lamestream Media, together with their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats, are trying to spread a new narrative that President Trump was slow in reacting to Covid 19,” he wrote, referring to himself in the third person. “Wrong, I was very fast, even doing the Ban on China long before anybody thought necessary!”\n\nThough the numbers of new cases and deaths have begun trending downward, health experts warn of a possible resurgence as lockdowns are lifted.More than 1.6 million people in the country have been infected. Hard-hit northeastern states have reported decreases in new cases in recent days, and the pace of deaths nationwide has fallen.\n\nThe daily death toll in New York, the hardest-hit state, fell this week to levels not seen since March.\n\nBut persistently high numbers of cases remain in a number of cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. Cases have been rising in Arkansas, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nMost statisticians and public health experts, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, say the death toll is probably far higher than official counts. People who haven’t been tested are dying at home and at nursing homes, and early this year some coronavirus deaths were probably misidentified.\n\nThe Times counted cases and deaths that have been identified by officials as probable coronavirus patients. Many states and counties only count cases and deaths in which an infection was confirmed through testing.\n\nBecause confirmed cases are widely considered to be an undercount of the true toll, some state and local governments have started identifying probable cases and deaths.\n\nThe milestone comes amid debate over the timeliness of the nation’s response to the pandemic, with one Columbia University model showing that about 36,000 fewer people would have died if the United States had acted earlier.Remembering the 100,000 Lives Lost to Coronavirus in America\n\nAs the U.S. reached a grim milestone in the outbreak, The New York Times gathered names of the dead and memories of their lives from obituaries across the country.Scientists are revising their timelines of how the virus spread.Image A transmission electron microscopic image of coronaviruses, in blue, from the first case of Covid-19 in the United States. Credit... Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images  The first confirmed infections in Europe and the United States, discovered in January, did not ignite the epidemics that followed, according to a close analysis of hundreds of viral genomes.\n\nThose outbreaks began weeks later, the study concluded. The revised timeline may clarify nagging ambiguities about the arrival of the pandemic, Carl Zimmer reports.\n\nFor example, while President Trump has frequently claimed that a ban on travelers from China prevented the outbreak from becoming much worse, the new data suggest that the virus that started Washington State’s epidemic arrived about two weeks after the ban was imposed on Feb. 2.\n\nAnd the authors argue that the relatively late emergence of the outbreak means that more lives could have been saved by early action, such as testing and contact tracing.\n\nThe new analysis is not the last word. Scientific understanding of the virus is evolving almost daily, and this type of research yields a range of possible results, not complete certainty.Many infections in Washington State seem to have occurred earlier in February, and other models suggested that the epidemic there began before the middle of the month.\n\nBut a number of virus experts said that the new report convincingly ruled out a connection between the first confirmed cases and the later outbreaks.\n\n“This paper clearly shows this didn’t happen,” said Kristian Andersen, a computational biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, who was not involved in the research.Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nTrack Covid-19 in your area, and get the latest state and county data on cases, deaths, hospitalizations, tests and vaccinations.California is the fourth state with at least 100,000 known cases.Image Downtown Los Angeles this month. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times  \n\nIn California, which has become the fourth state with at least 100,000 known infections, Gov. Gavin Newsom seems to be moving closer to handing the reins of reopening to county public health officials.The state joins Illinois, New Jersey and New York with the highest case counts.\n\nAt least 47 of California’s 58 counties have filed their so-called county variance attestations to prove that they meet the criteria to reopen more quickly than the rest of the state, the governor said. And he has been in talks with leaders in Los Angeles County, by most measures the hardest-hit part of the state, about the possibility of allowing some areas there to reopen more quickly than others.\n\nFor now, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles announced on Tuesday evening that “lower risk” in-store shopping could resume, many pools could open, and houses of worship could avail themselves of the new state guidelines.\n\nThe growing emphasis on local influence — state officials announced on Monday that places of worship could reopen at lower capacity only with the approval of county public health departments — could help Mr. Newsom mute his critics, some of whom have gone to court to challenge California’s restrictions.\n\nThe gradual changes in California reflect a national shift as states that had previously been among the most locked down begin loosening restrictions, often on a regional basis.\n\nThe rising case counts in parts of California come as other sections of the country — including the Minneapolis area, Wisconsin and parts of the South — have reported more infections. Those increasing numbers are certain to intensify debates over when and how the country should ease restrictions that were imposed to try to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nAfter months of lockdown, Illinois plans to lift restrictions on Friday on retail stores, gyms and personal care services in some areas, though the Chicago area will reopen on its own timeline. Washington, D.C., which has also been locked down, is also tentatively planning to open certain businesses on Friday.\n\nMayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta announced on Wednesday that the city would move to the second phase of its reopening plan and allow private gatherings of no more than 10 people, as long as they followed social-distancing guidelines.“Data shows that we are in a position to move forward,” the mayor said in a statement. “We encourage Atlantans citywide to continue to follow all precautionary guidelines as community transmission of Covid-19 still poses a threat to our city.”\n\nGov. Jay Inslee of Washington said on Wednesday that religious organizations could host up to 100 people on their properties for outdoor services, including weddings, funerals and religious holiday celebrations. People must wear face coverings and social distance. Choirs are not allowed, although people can sing with face coverings, because the louder that voices are projected, the farther germs travel, he said.\n\nAny counties that have entered the second phase of reopening can host indoor services of up to 25 percent of their capacity or 50 people, whatever is less. Seattle, in King County, is still in the first phase.Washington, D.C., will begin to loosen virus restrictions on Friday.Image Washington and its suburbs are among a handful of metropolitan areas that have expanded testing but failed to break 10 percent positive results. Credit... Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times  The mayor of Washington, D.C., said on Wednesday that the city would begin to loosen stay-at-home restrictions on Friday, even though the chief White House official overseeing the virus response said this week that the suburban region around the nation’s capital remained among the most worrisome metropolitan areas in the country.\n\n“The bottom line we do want to emphasize is this virus is still in our city and our region and our country,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said as she announced that restaurants would be able to allow outdoor seating for groups of six or fewer, hairstyling salons could provide services by appointment only and stores could open for curbside pickup. Gatherings of more than 10 people will remain prohibited.On Tuesday, the city had 72 new cases, bringing the total to 8,406, and five new deaths for a total of 445. Although Ms. Bowser said that the city had maintained 14 days of sustained decline in community transmission, there was a one-day increase this weekend.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, the lead coordinator of the White House virus task force, told the nation’s governors on Tuesday that Washington and its suburbs, as well as Baltimore, were among a handful of metropolitan areas that had expanded testing but failed to break 10 percent positive results. Northern Virginia is also expected to begin a first phase of reopening, even as cases there continue to rise. The Maryland suburbs near Washington — where cases have been highest — have moved more cautiously.\n\n“I want to make sure we all understand that moving into Phase 1 means that more people can get infected,” Ms. Bowser said, emphasizing that residents were expected to use masks and maintain social distancing and aggressive hand-washing. “We know that without a vaccine or a cure that we will see new infections.”\n\nShe added that City Hall would continue to encourage remote work for businesses and the federal government. “It cannot be said enough every single one of us has a role to play,” she said.The House holds its first partly remote vote.Image Representative Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, with House Republicans, addressing his opposition to remote voting during a news conference on Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times  The House of Representatives held its first partly remote vote on Wednesday, using a new proxy voting system instituted for the pandemic to approve a bill aimed at punishing China for human rights abuses against the Uighurs.\n\nDespite a Republican lawsuit seeking to block the practice, more than 70 Democrats took advantage of the procedures, which allow any absent lawmaker to designate another member who is physically present to record a vote on his or her behalf during periods when the speaker, the clerk and the sergeant-at-arms agree there is a state of emergency because of the virus.\n\nRepresentative Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, cast the first proxy vote in the chamber, on behalf of Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California.\n\n“I inform the House that Ms. Lofgren would vote yes,” Mr. Boyle said, reading from a designated script.\n\nBehind him, Democrats lined up to cast votes on behalf of their colleagues, as staff members frantically wiped down the microphone between votes.\n\nRepublicans have protested the historic change to House rules, adopted this month over their unanimous opposition, and filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block it.\n\nIn a heated debate on the House floor, Republican leaders laid out their case anew on Wednesday, arguing that there would be a cloud of suspicion over anything passed under the arrangement and the Senate might simply refuse to take it up.\n\n“Whatever the Democrats move forward probably will never become law,” the lead plaintiff, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, told reporters before the vote. No Republican voted by proxy.Kobe Bryant’s hall of fame induction is expected to be postponed until 2021.Image Kobe Bryant was to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in August, seven months after his death in a helicopter crash, but the ceremony apparently will be delayed until next year. Credit... Hannah Foslien/Getty Images  The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame induction for an exceptionally illustrious class, including the former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, will be postponed from August to next spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of the Hall of Fame’s board of governors, said on Wednesday.\n\nNo announcement will be official until the board of governors convenes on June 10, Colangelo said.\n\n“But that’s what I expect will be the outcome,” he said in an interview.\n\nBryant, who died at 41 in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, was voted into the Hall in April, as were his N.B.A. contemporaries Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett and the 10-time W.N.B.A. All-Star Tamika Catchings.\n\nThe enshrinement weekend was originally scheduled for Aug. 28-30, and Colangelo had proposed Oct. 10-12 as an alternative in case fears over the pandemic lingered. But Colangelo said it had become clear to him that neither weekend would be feasible.Workers removed from a Gulf of Mexico oil platform test positive for the virus.\n\nAt least five of the nine workers airlifted off a Shell-operated offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe confirmed cases are the first involving Shell workers, according to Cindy Babski, a company spokeswoman. The workers were transported to onshore medical facilities for testing and treatment, where two people tested negative and two results are pending. “All remaining personnel on this platform will be tested on the platform,” Ms. Babski said.\n\nShell said it would now test all personnel at medical clinics in Louisiana and Texas before they are flown to the nine offshore platforms the company operates in the Gulf of Mexico. The number of workers on each platform will be reduced to “minimum staffing levels,” the company said.\n\n“Shell’s priority remains the safety and health of our people and the safe operations of all our businesses,” the company said in a statement. “We have been and will continue to take steps to protect all employees following guidance from the C.D.C. and local public health officials.”\n\nThe safeguards are particularly important for Louisiana, a state dominated by the oil and gas industry. The Louisiana Oil and Gas Association has predicted that about half the state’s 33,714 oil and gas wells could be shut down in the coming months.Renters entered the pandemic at a disadvantage. Now laws safeguarding them are expiring.Image Emma Witbolsfeugen stood on the shoulder of I-70 in Independence, Mo., last month to rally for rent forgiveness. Credit... Christopher Smith for The New York Times  The United States, already wrestling with an economic collapse not seen in a generation, is on the precipice of a compounding crisis of evictions, as protections and payments extended to millions of people out of work begin to run out.\n\nThe fallout is predicted to be devastating for the nation’s renters, who entered the pandemic with lower incomes, significantly less in savings and housing costs that ate up more of their paychecks. They also were more likely to work in industries where job losses have been particularly severe.\n\nMany have been scraping by because of temporary government assistance and emergency orders that put many evictions on hold. But evictions will soon be allowed in about half of the states, according to Emily A. Benfer, a housing expert and associate professor at Columbia Law School who is tracking eviction policies.\n\n“I think we will enter into a severe renter crisis, and very quickly,” Professor Benfer said. Without a new round of government intervention, she added, “we will have an avalanche of evictions across the country.”\n\nThat means more and more families may soon face displacement at a time when people are still being urged to stay at home.\n\nIn many places, that has already begun. The Texas Supreme Court recently ruled that evictions could begin again. In the Oklahoma City area, sheriffs apologetically announced that they planned to start enforcing eviction notices this week. And a handful of states had few statewide protections in place to begin with, leaving residents particularly vulnerable as eviction cases stacked up.The Trump administration demands that virus rescue funds also go to private schools.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos said she would direct public school districts to share a large portion of federal rescue funding with private school students, regardless of income.\n\n“The CARES Act is a special, pandemic-related appropriation to benefit all American students, teachers and families,” Ms. DeVos wrote in a letter Friday, referring to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. “There is nothing in the act suggesting Congress intended to discriminate between children based on public or nonpublic school attendance, as you seem to do. The virus affects everyone.”\n\nA range of education officials said the guidance would divert millions of dollars from disadvantaged students and force districts to support even the wealthiest private schools.\n\nThe association representing the nation’s school superintendents told districts to ignore the guidance, and at least two states, Indiana and Maine, said they would.\n\nPrivate school leaders say they are also in crisis. Many of those schools serve low-income students whose parents have fled failing public schools. About 5.7 million students attend private schools, 30 percent of them from families with incomes below $75,000 a year. Private school groups say those families are most at risk without federal aid.\n\nUnder federal education law, school districts are required to use funding they receive for their poorest students to provide “equitable services,” such as tutoring and transportation for low-income students attending private schools in their districts. But Ms. DeVos’s guidance would award private schools more services than the law would normally require.\n\nLast week, key House and Senate Education Committee leaders, including Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said Ms. DeVos’s interpretation was flawed.\n\nDemocratic leaders called on Ms. DeVos to revise her guidance.A study of Louisiana hospitals highlights the pandemic’s disproportionate burden on communities of color.Image A funeral for Bessie Lacoste at Green Street Cemetery in New Orleans this month involved FaceTiming relatives. Credit... Annie Flanagan for The New York Times  Yet another medical study, this one by doctors at a large hospital system based in New Orleans, has called attention to the disproportionate burden the pandemic is taking on communities of color.\n\nThough the hospital system, Ochsner Health, serves a predominantly white population, most patients hospitalized with Covid-19 over a recent six-week period were black, according to research published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nOchsner Health operates hospitals and outpatient facilities throughout Louisiana. About 30 percent of the patient population is black. Among the 1,382 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from March 1 to April 11, however, 77 percent were black.\n\nBlack patients made up 80 percent of patients transferred to the intensive care unit and nearly 82 percent of those put on ventilators to help with breathing.\n\nBlack patients accounted for 70.6 percent of the 326 hospital patients who died.\n\nThe authors of the new study reported that compared with white patients who were hospitalized, black patients had higher rates of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, all of which have been linked to worse outcomes in patients with Covid-19.Minneapolis demonstrators put aside virus concerns to protest a death in police custody.Image Protesters in Minneapolis on Tuesday after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody. Credit... Kerem Yucel/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images  When hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Minneapolis on Tuesday night to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody, the large crowd was both a powerful call for action in the case and a precarious act as the virus was still flaring in the region.\n\nThe number of newly reported virus cases continues to climb in Minnesota, and the counties that make up the Minneapolis-St. Paul area lead the state in both total and new cases. The Twin Cities metro area also accounted for a surge in patients requiring hospitalization in intensive care.\n\nStill, demonstrators gathered for a rare large protest since the pandemic began.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said he understood and supported the rights of people who protested the episode, but he asked that they wear masks and respect social distancing procedures.\n\n“I encourage people to voice their opinions and anger, their heartbreak and their sadness, because undoubtedly it will be there,” he said.\n\nMany protesters wore face coverings, and some brought hand sanitizer. But the group as a whole seemed to send a message that their desire for justice had outweighed safety concerns as they gathered at the intersection where Mr. Floyd, 46, had been pinned down by the police a day earlier and captured on video saying, “I can’t breathe.”\n\nAs protesters yelled about Mr. Floyd’s death, some pulled their masks aside to be fully heard. One woman said, “anyone worried about social distancing should have just stayed home.”Disney World will reopen in July.Image An empty Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla.  Credit... Eve Edelheit for The New York Times  Walt Disney World in Florida, one of the world’s largest tourist sites that draws 93 million people a year, will reopen to the public on a limited basis in mid-July.\n\nDisney presented its reopening plan on Wednesday to the Orange County Recovery Task Force in Orlando. Two of Disney World’s four main theme parks, the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom, will reopen on July 11 with reduced capacity and numerous safety precautions, including mandatory face masks for all visitors and employees. The remaining major parks, Epcot and Hollywood Studios, will reopen on July 15. The resort has been closed since March 15.\n\nDisney said its approach to reopening would include increased use of plexiglass barriers and contactless payment systems. All visitors will need a reservation. Temperature checks will be conducted at entrances. Disney also said its parades, fireworks displays and character meet-and-greets would be suspended because of crowd control concerns.Stocks rise for a second day based on expectations for an eventual recovery.Image Trading on Wall Street reflected optimism about a return to normal as states and national governments lift stay-at-home restrictions. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times  Wall Street climbed for a second day on Wednesday as investors kept their focus on the prospect of economic recovery.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 rose 1.5 percent — after swinging between gains and losses earlier in the day as weakness in large technology stocks offset gains in other parts of the market. The S&amp;P 500 had climbed 1.2 percent on Tuesday.\n\nThe trading on Wednesday reflected optimism about a return to normal as states and national governments lifted stay-at-home restrictions. Companies that will benefit as shoppers are allowed back in stores and people begin to travel again were among the best performers in the S&amp;P 500. Nordstrom, Gap and Kohl’s each rose more than 14 percent.Though stocks have been rising lately, trading has been unsteady with the S&amp;P 500 alternating between gains and losses on a near-daily basis, as expectations for an eventual recovery have squared off against the reality that the damage is still severe and likely to continue.\n\nBoeing said Wednesday that it was laying off more than 6,700 employees in the United States, all of whom will be notified this week. Another 5,500 workers have been approved for voluntary buyouts and will leave in weeks.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic’s devastating impact on the airline industry means a deep cut in the number of commercial jets and services our customers will need over the next few years,” the chief executive, David L. Calhoun, said in a note to employees.Democratic lawmakers ask the Trump administration to shelve plans for a big Fourth of July event.\n\nA group of Democratic lawmakers from the Washington area told the Trump administration this week that they believed it would be “impossible” to safely stage a major celebration around Independence Day in the nation’s capital this summer.\n\n“We believe such an event would needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans,” the lawmakers — two senators, seven representatives and the District of Columbia’s nonvoting House delegate — wrote in a letter to the defense and interior secretaries.\n\nPresident Trump, a vocal proponent of patriotic displays that critics have sometimes condemned as extravagant or politically motivated, suggested in April that Fourth of July festivities in Washington would have more limited attendance.“This year, most likely, we’ll be standing six feet apart,” he said. “We’ll have to do that in a very, very interesting way. And we’ll even do it greater, so we’ll leave a little extra distance.”\n\nThis week, though, the lawmakers asked the administration to shelve any plans entirely. The Washington area has struggled to contain the virus, and the lawmakers warned that holding a mass gathering along the National Mall would be perilous.\n\nThousands of people attended a “Salute to America” event last year, which Mr. Trump had pledged would be a “show of a lifetime.” The president was flanked by Bradley armored vehicles and M1A2 tanks at the event, held at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n“The administration, including your agencies, should be focusing on helping American families, not on a vanity project for the president,” the lawmakers wrote.France is no longer allowing hydroxychloroquine, a drug promoted by Trump, as a treatment.\n\nFrance revoked the authorization allowing the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 patients on Wednesday, a day after halting its use in clinical trials.\n\nThe drug, which has been heavily promoted by President Trump despite the lack of evidence that it is effective against the virus, was temporarily removed from global safety trials earlier this week by the World Health Organization, which called for a review of new safety concerns.Is your family more ‘together,’ or less?\n\nAll this time with your family may have led to greater feelings of connectedness.

They also allegedly love to run parent-teacher associations so they can impose their views on both their children and school staff.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the term was extended to ‘Coronavirus Karen’ – the kind of woman who refuses to wear a mask in shops.\n\nLast year, the pizza delivery company Domino’s offered Karens in New Zealand the chance to win a free pizza ‘as a break from negativity’. However, the deal was scrapped after a backlash.\n\nIncidentally, the word ‘Karen’ also refers to a group of Sino-Tibetan-speaking people in Burma.\n\nAnother continued: The way people have managed to turn this into a joke is honestly so unsurprising. \n\nA whole costume for a label thats supposed to identify women who weaponize their whiteness to brutalize black people. \n\nJust like the wig that comes with the costume, a defining visual feature of a ‘Karen’ is supposedly her hairstyle.\n\nIt is seen as an outdated, inverted bob or an asymmetric fringe – typical of the 1990s or early 2000s – with lots of volume, plenty of hair spray and ill-placed layers. \n\nCritics – and many women called Karen – have condemned the outfit for attacking those who simply have a strong sense of right and wrong.\n\nSince 2020, the term ‘Karen’ has also been linked with opposition to Black Lives Matter protests.  \n\nIt comes after three women called Karen were mocked by This Morning viewers for suggesting they are victims of discrimination as a result of their name. \n\nKaren Masters, from Oxfordshire, Karen Serfass, from Pennsylvania and Karen Triggs, from Gloucestershire appeared on the show to speak about the term - and agreed when host Eamon Holmes said it was almost racist to use the term.\n\nKaren Masters said that as Karens they were unable to speak about how the meme has affected their lives, because they fear being labelled entitled and insisted that Karens just arent that sort of person.\n\nOne of the Karens even admitted shes changing her name, because she wants to prevent the negative connotations from affecting her on a deeper level - revealing shes even sometimes forced to hide her name tag at work.\n\nIt all started off a couple of months ago, said Masters. I noticed some memes on TikTok and it was quite funny to begin with. But when the Black Lives Matter protests started and there was a lot of media saying Karens were racist, it took on a life of it’s own.\n\nI feel we cant, as Karens, can’t talk about how this is affecting us, because then we are entitled if we do this. So I set up a Change.org to say this is not fair, us having to put up with this.\n\nWe are labelled as racist and entitled and we are just not that sort of person, and we want the media to stop using our name to describe racist people.Read more         Go to MSN Home                                                                                                                                     AdChoices                                                                                                                                                         AdChoices                                                More From Daily Mail                Queen Letizia of Spain cuts a lowkey figure in Paraguay       Daily Mail                                                                              Dennis Quaid, 67, takes dog Peaches for NYC walk solo       Daily Mail                                                                              Marianne Power admits...

Moreover, because of the next-generation sequencing revolution, datasets used for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace. RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a popular program for phylogenetic analyses of large datasets under maximum likelihood. Since the last RAxML paper in 2006, it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community. Results: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of RAxML, such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of SSE3, AVX and AVX2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting post-analyses on sets of trees. In addition, an up-to-date 50-page user manual covering all new RAxML options is available.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) now surpass other, previously competitive battery types (for example, lead–acid and nickel metal hydride) but still require extensive further improvement to, in particular, extend the operation hours of mobile IT devices and the driving mileages of all-electric vehicles. In this Review, we present a critical overview of a wide range of post-LIB materials and systems that could have a pivotal role in meeting such demands. We divide battery systems into two categories: near-term and long-term technologies. To provide a realistic and balanced perspective, we describe the operating principles and remaining issues of each post-LIB technology, and also evaluate these materials under commercial cell configurations. Post-lithium-ion batteries are reviewed with a focus on their operating principles, advantages and the challenges that they face. The volumetric energy density of each battery is examined using a commercial pouch-cell configuration to evaluate its practical significance and identify appropriate research directions.', '2016', 2151, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

Without larger prospective observational studies that are only now being started, clinicians can retrieve information just from case reports and or small studies. This is the time to understand how COVID-19 goes forward and what consequences survivors may expect to experience. To this aim, a multidisciplinary post-acute care service involving several specialists has been established at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCSS (Rome, Italy).

Yet from a conceptual standpoint, few empirical studies have made a distinction between individuals pre-adoption and post-adoption (continued use) beliefs and attitudes. This distinction is crucial in understanding and managing this process over time. The current study combines innovation diffusion and attitude theories in a theoretical framework to examine differences in pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs and attitudes. The examination of Windows technology in a single organization indicates that users and potential adopters of information technology differ on their determinants of behavioral intention, attitude, and subjective norm. Potential adopter intention to adopt is solely determined by normative pressures, whereas user intention is solely determined by attitude. In addition, potential adopters base their attitude on a richer set of innovation characteristics than users. Whereas pre-adoption attitude is based on perceptions of usefulness, ease-of-use, result demonstrability, visibility, and trialability, post-adoption attitude is only based on instrumentality beliefs of usefulness and perceptions of image enhancements.', '1999', 3482, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

In a typical crowdsensing system, the task owner usually needs to provide incentives to the users (say participants) to encourage their participation. Among existing incentive mechanisms, posted pricing has been widely adopted because it is easy to implement while ensuring truthfulness and fairness. One critical challenge to the task owner is to set the right posted price to recruit a crowd with small total payment and reasonable sensing quality, i.e., posted pricing problem for robust crowdsensing. However, this fundamental problem remains largely open so far. In this paper, we model the robustness requirement over sensing data quality as chance constraints in an elegant manner, and study a series of chance constrained posted pricing problems in crowdsensing systems. Although some chance-constrained optimization techniques have been applied in the literature, they cannot provide any performance guarantees for their solutions. In this work, we propose a binary search based algorithm, and show that using this algorithm allows us to establish theoretical guarantees on its performance.

In this study, we examine which attributes of profile and posted images are associated with depression and anxiety of Twitter users. We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook users to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and anxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken anxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132 Twitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and extracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the associations with users depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics. For depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather than display more negative emotions, likely because of social media self-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user (rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the self, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of anxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but less so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can be used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that includes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance. Overall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety offer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the psychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the mental health status of users.', '2019', 24, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=posted&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

In this paper, we investigate the performance of posted price mechanisms when customers arrive in an unknown random order. We compare the expected revenue of these mechanisms to the expected revenue of the optimal auction in two different settings. Namely, the nonadaptive setting in which all offers are sent to the customers beforehand, and the adaptive setting in which an offer is made when a consumer arrives. For the nonadaptive case, we obtain a strategy achieving an expected revenue within at least a 1-1/e fraction of that of the optimal auction. We also show that this bound is tight, even if the customers have i.i.d. valuations for the item. For the adaptive case, we exhibit a posted price mechanism that achieves a factor 0.745 of the optimal revenue, when the customers have i.i.d. valuations for the item.

Design Computer-assisted quantitative and qualitative studies of 228 113 comments (28 971 142 words) of online feedback posted to the NHS Choices website. Comments containing the most frequent positive and negative evaluative words are qualitatively examined to determine the key drivers of positive and negative feedback. Participants Contributors posting comments about the NHS between March 2013 and September 2015. Results Overall, NHS services were evaluated positively approximately three times more often than negatively. The four key areas of focus were: treatment, communication, interpersonal skills and system/organisation. Treatment exhibited the highest proportion of positive evaluative comments (87%), followed by communication (77%), interpersonal skills (44%) and, finally, system/organisation (41%). Qualitative analysis revealed that reference to staff interpersonal skills featured prominently, even in comments relating to treatment and system/organisational issues. Positive feedback was elicited in cases of staff being caring, compassionate and knowing patients’’ names, while rudeness, apathy and not listening were frequent drivers of negative feedback. Conclusions Although technical competence constitutes an undoubtedly fundamental aspect of healthcare provision, staff members were much more likely to be evaluated both positively and negatively according to their interpersonal skills. Therefore, the findings reported in this study highlight the salience of such ‘soft’ skills to patients and emphasise the need for these to be focused upon and developed in staff training programmes, as well as ensuring that decisions around NHS funding do not result in demotivated and rushed staff. The findings also reveal a significant overlap between the four key themes in the ways that care is evaluated by patients.', '2017', 64, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=posted&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

Our result is constructive: given black-box access to a combinatorial auction algorithm A, sample access to the prior distribution, and appropriate query access to the sampled valuations, one can compute, in polytime, prices that guarantee at least half of the expected welfare of A. As a corollary, we obtain the first polytime (in n and m) constant-factor DSIC mechanism for Bayesian submodular combinatorial auctions, given access to demand query oracles.

Recently, mechanisms of this type have been developed to incentivize effort exertion, in addition to truthful elicitation. In this paper, we study a sequential peer prediction problem where a data requester wants to dynamically determine the reward level to optimize the trade-off between the quality of information elicited from workers and the total expected payment. In this problem, workers have homogeneous expertise and heterogeneous cost for exerting effort, both unknown to the requester. We propose a sequential posted-price mechanism to dynamically learn the optimal reward level from workers contributions and to incentivize effort exertion and truthful reporting. We show that (1) in our mechanism, workers exerting effort according to a non-degenerate threshold policy and then reporting truthfully is an equilibrium that returns highest utility for each worker, and (2) The regret of our learning mechanism w.r.t. offering the optimal reward (price) is upper bounded by $	ilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ where $T$ is the learning horizon.

Bloomfield', 'INTRODUCTION\nSince 1995, the European Association of Pathologists (EAHP) and the Society for Hematopathology (SH) have been developing a new World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of hematologic malignancies. The classification includes lymphoid, myeloid, histiocytic, and mast cell neoplasms.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe WHO project involves 10 committees of pathologists, who have developed lists and definitions of disease entities. A Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC)) of international hematologists and oncologists was formed to ensure that the classification will be useful to clinicians. A meeting was held in November, 1997, to discuss clinical issues related to the classification.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe WHO has adopted the Revised European American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (R.E.A.L.), published in 1994 by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG), as the classification of lymphoid neoplasms. This approach to classification is based on the principle that a classification is a list of real disease entities, which are defined by a combination of morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, and clinical features. The relative importance of each of these features varies among diseases, and there is no one gold standard. The WHO Classification has applied the principles of the R.E.A.L. Classification to myeloid and histiocytic neoplasms. The classification of myeloid neoplasms recognizes distinct entities defined by a combination of morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. The CAC meeting, which was organized around a series of clinical questions, was able to reach a consensus on most of the questions posed. The questions and the consensus are discussed in detail below. Among other things, the CAC concluded that clinical groupings of lymphoid neoplasms were neither necessary nor desirable. Patient treatment is determined by the specific type of lymphoma, with the addition of grade within the tumor type, if applicable, and clinical prognostic factors such as the international prognostic index (IPI).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe experience of developing the WHO Classification has produced a new and exciting degree of cooperation and communication between oncologists and pathologists from around the world, which should facilitate progress in the understanding and treatment of hematologic malignancies.', '1999', 3187, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=november&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

However, two magnitude-5 earthquakes recently occurred in South Korea during EGS site development. Grigoli et al. and Kim et al. present seismic and geophysical evidence that may implicate the second of these earthquakes, which occurred in Pohang, as an induced event. The combination of data from a local seismometer network, well logs, satellite observations, teleseismic waveform analysis, and stress modeling leads to the assessment that the earthquake was probably or almost certainly anthropogenically induced. The possibility remains that the earthquake occurred coincidentally at the EGS site location, but the aftershock distribution and other lines of evidence are concerning for future development of this geothermal resource. Science, this issue p. 1003, p. 1007 Last year’s Pohang, South Korea, earthquake was potentially an induced earthquake from an enhanced geothermal system. The moment magnitude (Mw) 5.5 earthquake that struck South Korea in November 2017 was one of the largest and most damaging events in that country over the past century. Its proximity to an enhanced geothermal system site, where high-pressure hydraulic injection had been performed during the previous 2 years, raises the possibility that this earthquake was anthropogenic. We have combined seismological and geodetic analyses to characterize the mainshock and its largest aftershocks, constrain the geometry of this seismic sequence, and shed light on its causal factors. According to our analysis, it seems plausible that the occurrence of this earthquake was influenced by the aforementioned industrial activities. Finally, we found that the earthquake transferred static stress to larger nearby faults, potentially increasing the seismic hazard in the area.', '2018', 205, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=november&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

As reported in this edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, people have never consumed so much fish or depended so greatly on the sector for their well-being as today. As the demand for fish increases, the sector is also striving to be more productive and sustainable and to enable more inclusive and efficient systems while reducing rural poverty and enhancing the resilience of livelihoods to disasters, crises and climate change. Global fish production growth continues to outpace world population growth. In 2012, while global marine capture fishery production was stable at about 80 million tonnes, global aquaculture production set another all-time high at more than 90 million tonnes (including almost 24 million tonnes of aquatic plants). Aquaculture remains one of the fastest-growing food-producing sectors and is set to play a key role in meeting the rising demand for fishery products. The proportion of assessed marine fish stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels exceeded 70 percent in 2011, while fewer than 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished. Of the stocks assessed, fully fished stocks accounted for over 60 percent and underfished stocks about 10 percent. The share of fisheries production used for direct human consumption increased from about 70 percent in the 1980s to more than 85 percent (136 million tonnes) in 2012. With this increasing production and greater availability for consumers, per capita fish consumption continues to rise – up from 10 kg in the 1960s to more than 19 kg in 2012 – driven by higher demand from a growing population, rising incomes, and more efficient distribution channels.

Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term CpG island shores. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45–65%) of the locations of colon cancer–related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer.', '2009', 1987, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=shows&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.

Tropical cyclones downscaled from the climate of the period 1950–2005 are compared with those of the 21st century in simulations that stipulate that the radiative forcing from greenhouse gases increases by over preindustrial values. In contrast to storms that appear explicitly in most global models, the frequency of downscaled tropical cyclones increases during the 21st century in most locations. The intensity of such storms, as measured by their maximum wind speeds, also increases, in agreement with previous results. Increases in tropical cyclone activity are most prominent in the western North Pacific, but are evident in other regions except for the southwestern Pacific.

Ikeno', 'Objective: In this study, the effects of overexpression of thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) on aging and age-related diseases were examined using Trx2 transgenic mice [Tg(TXN2)+/0]. Because our previous studies demonstrated that thioredoxin (Trx) overexpression in the cytosol (Trx1) did not extend maximum lifespan, this study was conducted to test if increased Trx2 expression in mitochondria shows beneficial effects on aging and age-related pathology. Methods: Trx2 transgenic mice were generated using a fragment of the human genome containing the TXN2 gene. Effects of Trx2 overexpression on survival, age-related pathology, oxidative stress, and redox-sensitive signaling pathways were examined in male Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice. Results: Trx2 levels were significantly higher (approximately 1.6- to 5-fold) in all of the tissues we examined in Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates, and the expression levels were maintained during aging (up to 22-24 months old). Trx2 overexpression did not alter the levels of Trx1, glutaredoxin, glutathione, or other major antioxidant enzymes. Overexpression of Trx2 was associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from mitochondria and lower isoprostane levels compared to WT mice. When we conducted the survival study, male Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice showed a slight extension (approximately 8-9%) of mean, median, and 10th percentile lifespans; however, the survival curve was not significantly different from WT mice. Cross-sectional pathological analysis (22-24 months old) showed that Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice had a slightly higher severity of lymphoma; however, tumor burden, disease burden, and severity of glomerulonephritis and inflammation were similar to WT mice. Trx2 overexpression was also associated with higher c-Jun and c-Fos levels; however, mTOR activity and levels of NFκB p65 and p50 were similar to WT littermates. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the increased levels of Trx2 in mitochondria over the lifespan in Tg(TXN2)+/0 mice showed a slight life-extending effect, reduced ROS production from mitochondria and oxidative damage to lipids, but showed no significant effects on aging and and age-related diseases.

In this study, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of the apigenin, luteolin and myricetin will be new knowledge about preventive strategies against epithelial ovarian cancer in which the effect of flavonoids is still unclear. The cytotoxic effect of flavonoids was assessed by MTT analysis of the ovarian cancer cells (A2780, OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3) in comparison to the ovarian epithelial cells (OSE). The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl levels, caspase-3 and -9 activities were evaluated using fluorescence spectrometry. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and cell invasion were measured by flow cytometry and Boyden chamber assay, respectively. MTT analysis showed that flavonoids selectively decreased the cell viability of cancer cells. Furthermore, the intracellular ROS generation was induced or scavenged by flavonoids depending on the structural differences. The flavonoids increased MDA levels due to the disruption of the membrane. Caspase activities indicated that flavonoids activated the extrinsic apoptotic pathway when ROS was scavenged. In contrast, the induced intracellular ROS generation resulted in the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, the cell cycle was arrested in different cell cycle phases and cell invasion on the collagen was disrupted by flavonoids. The anticancer activities of apigenin, luteolin and myricetin were attributed to the alterations of ROS signaling, and as well as the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and abrogation of the invasion.

Giraldez', 'Translation Block MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA genes that are found in the genomes of most eukaryotes, where they play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Although whether gene activity is repressed by blocking translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, or by promoting their deadenylation and then degradation, has been open to debate. Bazzini et al. (p. 233, published online 15 March) and Djuranovic et al. (p. 237) looked at early points in the repression reaction in the zebrafish embryo or in Drosophila tissue culture cells, respectively, and found that translation was blocked before target mRNAs were significantly deadenylated and degraded. Thus, miRNAs appear to interfere with the initiation step of translation. MicroRNAs act to repress their messenger RNA targets first by blocking translation initiation and then through degradation. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression through deadenylation, repression, and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. However, the contribution of each mechanism in non-steady-state situations remains unclear. We monitored the impact of miR-430 on ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in wild-type and dicer mutant zebrafish embryos and found that miR-430 reduces the number of ribosomes on target mRNAs before causing mRNA decay. Translational repression occurs before complete deadenylation, and disrupting deadenylation with use of an internal polyadenylate tail did not block target repression. Lastly, we observed that ribosome density along the length of the message remains constant, suggesting that translational repression occurs by reducing the rate of initiation rather than affecting elongation or causing ribosomal drop-off. These results show that miR-430 regulates translation initiation before inducing mRNA decay during zebrafish development.', '2012', 652, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=shows&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

Group 1 root canals were prepared with Hyflex rotary files according to the manufacter’s instructions. Group 2 with NiTi manual instruments in crown-down technique. Based on radiographs taken prior to instrumentation with the initial instruments inserted into the canals, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to the angle of canal curvature and working length. Canals were prepared using a crown - down preparation technique as instructed by the manufacturer. Group 1 was prepared by rotary Hyflex files and group 2 was prepared by NiTiflex hand-operated instruments. The assessment of changes of canal curvature and working length was based on radiographs taken prior and post instrumentation. The time required for canal preparation was recorded for each specimen. Postoperative teeth were examined clinically and radiographically after 1 week and 3 months. Research design was prospective clinical trials, group comparison. Data was statistically analysed using the SPSS 16.0 software.\nResults: Rotary Hyflex files prepared significantly faster and maintained the original canal curvature better than hand - operated Nitiflex files (p < 0.05). There was no significant differences in maintaining initial working length of two groups (p > 0.05) and both hand NiTiflex and rotary Hyflex instruments showed 1 case of ledge formation for each, 1 NiTiflex file separation and no perforation or apical transportion. Three-month clinical results were equal: in rotary Hyflex group, 90% teeth of successful result, 10% teeth in suspect; in NiTiflex hand-operated group, 80% ratio of successfully- treated teeth, 10% suspect and 10% failing result.\nConclusions: Under the conditions of this clinical study, both instruments were safe to use, showed equally efficacy in preparing root canals and endodontic clinical results. However, rotary Hyflex significantly reduced working time and respected original canal curvature better than hand–operated NiTiflex files, with higher treatment cost from 9 to 10 times.\n\nKey words: cleaning, shaping, root canals, rotary, canal curvature', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nbsp&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

One of the main challenges for test repair, in particular, is preserving the intent of the original tests in the repaired ones. To address this challenge, we propose a technique for test repair that models and considers the intent of a test when repairing it. Our technique first uses a search-based approach to generate repair candidates for the broken test. It then computes, for each candidate, its likelihood of preserving the original test intent. To do so, the technique characterizes such intent using the path conditions generated during a dynamic symbolic execution of the tests. Finally, the technique reports the best candidates to the developer as repair recommendations. We implemented and evaluated our technique on a benchmark of 91 broken tests in 4 open-source programs. Our results are promising, in that the technique was able to generate intentpreserving repair candidates for over 79% of those broken tests and rank the intent-preserving candidates as the first choice of repair recommendations for almost 70% of the broken tests.', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nbsp&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTo align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nSTAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field. One of the most recognizable features of galaxies along the Hubble sequence is the wide range in young stellar content and star formation activity. This variation in stellar content is part of the basis of the Hubble classification itself (Hubble 1926), and understanding its physical nature and origins is fundamental to understanding galaxy evolution in its broader context. This review deals with the global star formation properties of galaxies, the systematics of those properties along the Hubble sequence, and their implications for galactic evolution. I interpret “Hubble sequence” in this context very loosely, to encompass not only morphological type but other properties such as gas content, mass, bar structure, and dynamical environment, which can strongly influence the largescale star formation rate (SFR).', '1998', 4809, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=star&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 ± 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well.

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic \"dark ages\" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z~1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ~1% of todays stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.', '2014', 1682, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=star&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars.

The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star.

Takatsuka', 'In recent years our understanding of neutron stars has advanced remarkably, thanks to research converging from many directions. The importance of understanding neutron star behavior and structure has been underlined by the recent direct detection of gravitational radiation from merging neutron stars. The clean identification of several heavy neutron stars, of order two solar masses, challenges our current understanding of how dense matter can be sufficiently stiff to support such a mass against gravitational collapse. Programs underway to determine simultaneously the mass and radius of neutron stars will continue to constrain and inform theories of neutron star interiors. At the same time, an emerging understanding in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of how nuclear matter can evolve into deconfined quark matter at high baryon densities is leading to advances in understanding the equation of state of the matter under the extreme conditions in neutron star interiors. We review here the equation of state of matter in neutron stars from the solid crust through the liquid nuclear matter interior to the quark regime at higher densities. We focus in detail on the question of how quark matter appears in neutron stars, and how it affects the equation of state. After discussing the crust and liquid nuclear matter in the core we briefly review aspects of microscopic quark physics relevant to neutron stars, and quark models of dense matter based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio framework, in which gluonic processes are replaced by effective quark interactions. We turn then to describing equations of state useful for interpretation of both electromagnetic and gravitational observations, reviewing the emerging picture of hadron-quark continuity in which hadronic matter turns relatively smoothly, with at most only a weak first order transition, into quark matter with increasing density. We review construction of unified equations of state that interpolate between the reasonably well understood nuclear matter regime at low densities and the quark matter regime at higher densities. The utility of such interpolations is driven by the present inability to calculate the dense matter equation of state in QCD from first principles. As we review, the parameters of effective quark models-which have direct relevance to the more general structure of the QCD phase diagram of dense and hot matter-are constrained by neutron star mass and radii measurements, in particular favoring large repulsive density-density and attractive diquark pairing interactions. We describe the structure of neutron stars constructed from the unified equations of states with crossover.

To check the consistency of spectral types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra taken with the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. Combining these new types with published spectral types, and photometry from the literature (Johnson-Cousins BV IC, 2MASS JHKS and WISE W1, W2, W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral type-color sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars. Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective temperatures (Teff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new Teff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf star scales.

By sampling these electric fields in the direction of the longest (>50 km), high-voltage (275 and 400 kV) Scottish power transmission lines and integrating along their lengths, we estimate their associated transmission-line voltages. Lateral electrical conductivity variations in the Earth generate horizontal magnetic field gradients.

For the September 2017 storm, we also compare our estimated electric fields with a unique dataset comprising measured storm-time electric fields from 7 MT sites. We find that peak-to-peak, electric field magnitudes may have reached 13 V/km during the Halloween storm in some areas of the Scottish Highlands, with line-averaged electric fields >5 V/km sustained along a number of long-distance, high-voltage power transmission lines; line-averaged electric fields for the September 2017 storm are 1 V/km or less.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, Halloween activities will be curtailed as a result of the concern that candy from strangers might act as fomites. Here, we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that, prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands and, after receipt, by washing candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent. We conclude that with reasonable precautions, even if followed only by either the candy giver or the candy recipient, the risk of viral transmission by this route is very low. ABSTRACT Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols, transmission by fomites remains plausible. During Halloween, a major event for children in numerous countries, SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk via candy fomites worries many parents. To address this concern, we enrolled 10 recently diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly/moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients to handle typical Halloween candy (pieces individually wrapped) under three conditions: normal handling with unwashed hands, deliberate coughing and extensive touching, and normal handling following handwashing. We then used a factorial design to subject the candies to two posthandling treatments: no washing (untreated) and household dishwashing detergent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 load by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). From the candies not washed posthandling, we detected SARS-CoV-2 on 60% of candies that were deliberately coughed on, 60% of candies normally handled with unwashed hands, but only 10% of candies handled after hand washing. We found that treating candy with dishwashing detergent reduced SARS-CoV-2 load by 62.1% in comparison to untreated candy. Taken together, these results suggest that although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is low even from known COVID-19 patients, viral RNA load can be reduced to near zero by the combination of handwashing by the infected patient and ≥1 min detergent treatment after collection. We also found that the inexpensive and fast LAMP protocol was more than 80% concordant with RT-qPCR.

In the last 18 years, several enzymes responsible for ecdysteroid biosynthesis encoded by Halloween genes were identified and genetically and biochemically characterized. However, the tertiary structures of these proteins have not yet been characterized. Here, we report the results of an integrated series of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses of the Halloween GST protein Noppera-bo (Nobo). We determined crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster Nobo (DmNobo) complexed with GSH and 17β-estradiol, a DmNobo inhibitor. 17β-Estradiol almost fully occupied the putative ligand-binding pocket and a prominent hydrogen bond formed between 17β-estradiol and Asp-113 of DmNobo. We found that Asp-113 is essential for 17β-estradiol–mediated inhibition of DmNobo enzymatic activity, as 17β-estradiol did not inhibit and physically interacted less with the D113A DmNobo variant. Asp-113 is highly conserved among Nobo proteins, but not among other GSTs, implying that this residue is important for endogenous Nobo function. Indeed, a homozygous nobo allele with the D113A substitution exhibited embryonic lethality and an undifferentiated cuticle structure, a phenocopy of complete loss-of-function nobo homozygotes. These results suggest that the nobo family of GST proteins has acquired a unique amino acid residue that appears to be essential for binding an endogenous sterol substrate to regulate ecdysteroid biosynthesis. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study describing the structural characteristics of insect steroidogenic Halloween proteins.

METHODS: We collected data on confirmed pediatric cases of anaphylaxis presenting to emergency departments in 4 Canadian provinces as part of the Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis Registry. We assessed the mean number of cases per day and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of anaphylaxis induced by unknown nuts, peanuts and tree nuts presenting during each of 6 holidays (Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Diwali, Chinese New Year and Eid al-Adha) versus the rest of the year. We estimated IRRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Data were collected for 1390 pediatric cases of anaphylaxis between 2011 and 2020. Their median age was 5.4 years, and 864 (62.2%) of the children were boys. During Halloween and Easter, there were higher rates of anaphylaxis to unknown nuts (IRR 1.66, 95% CI 1.13–2.43 and IRR 1.71, 95% CI 1.21–2.42, respectively) and peanuts (IRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.12–3.11 and IRR 1.57, 95% CI 0.94–2.63, respectively) compared to the rest of the year.

Rather than treating this incident as a problem of moral hygiene—in which products are removed, apologies made, and lessons learned—we consider the value of Halloween as a unique and disruptive ethical encounter with the uncanny Other. Looking beyond its commercial appeal and controversy, we reflect on the creative, generous, and disruptive potential of Halloween as both tension-management ritual and unique organizational space of hospitality through which to receive and embrace alterity and so discover the homely within the unheimlich.', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=halloween&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

('looks', 5, 'Artificial Intelligence With Deep Learning Technology Looks Into Diabetic Retinopathy Screening.', 'T. Wong, N. Bressler', 'Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision loss in the United States and globally, particularly among working-aged people. Diabetic retinopathy meets all the criteria for screening: first, the condition (diabetic retinopathy) is an important public health care problem; second, the epidemiology and natural history of the condition, including development from asymptomatic latent to severe disease, is adequately understood; third, the screening test (retinal photography) is simple, safe, validated, and acceptable; and fourth, an effective treatment (intravitreous injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor or laser therapy for severe diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular edema [DME]) is available for patients identified through early detection. Diabetic retinopathy screening has long been recommended by the American Diabetes Association, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and many international societies. However, if this is true, why is diabetic retinopathy screening not widely implemented and not routinely practiced? A fundamental problem is the potential number of patients with the disease and the resources needed to address this. Estimates from the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that diabetic retinopathy affects at least 5 million people older than 40 years in the United States,1 and estimates from the World Health Organization suggest that diabetic retinopathy affects more than 100 million people globally.2 In the United States alone, if diabetic retinopathy screening was made universal, it is estimated that the annual number of retinal images requiring evaluation would be 32 million per year.3 Deep learning is a new branch of machine learning technology under the broad term of artificial intelligence. Google and other technology companies (eg, Facebook, Apple) have been using deep learning for big data analysis for years to predict how individuals search the Internet, where they like to travel, what they like to purchase, what is their favorite food, and who are their potential friends. Deep learning has substantial potential for health care and may allow the identification of which patients are likely to develop a particular disease and, among those with a particular condition, which patients need to be seen more frequently and perhaps treated more aggressively and determination of what specific treatments may be most appropriate for these patients (ie, “precision medicine”). As a natural extension of the use of artificial intelligence from mainstream daily life to medicine, Gulshan and colleagues4 in this issue of JAMA report the use of deep learning technology for diabetic retinopathy screening. Using large data sets of images (n = 128 175) to first “train” an algorithm, then using 2 separate data sets (n = 9963 images and n = 1748 images) to “test” this algorithm, the authors showed that this novel diabetic retinopathy screening software based on deep learning techniques had an 87% to 90% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, which was defined as moderate or worse diabetic retinopathy or referable DME. Based on these results of high sensitivity and high specificity for detecting diabetic retinopathy, the authors suggest that future research involving diabetic retinopathy screening software developed from deep learning algorithms is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in diabetic retinopathy screening programs and determining whether the use of the algorithm ultimately could lead to improved patient care and outcomes. The strengths of the study are clear, including the cuttingedge technology that was applied, a large number of retinal image data sets, and performance indicators (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) that are substantially better than what screening guidelines would recommend (typically >80% sensitivity and specificity). However, there are many challenges to immediate adoption of the software for clinical translation and utility in diabetic retinopathy screening programs. First, there are limitations in the present study, some of which the authors have appropriately acknowledged. For example, the study used a complicated definition of a gold standard (a majority decision of a panel of US board-certified ophthalmologists) to develop and validate their algorithm. This may compare unfavorably with standardized, centralized assessment of images usually used, for example, in large clinical trials (eg, fundus photographs evaluated in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study,5 in which images were graded centrally in a “reading center”) or using more precise methods to detect DME (eg, optical coherence tomography6). If Gulshan et al had used such a reading center or optical coherence tomography as their gold standard, would similar outcomes have been obtained? Another limitation is that even though the authors concentrated their report on the performance of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate or worse diabetic retinopathy and DME), the authors did not provide comparable data on “sightthreatening diabetic retinopathy” (severe diabetic retinopaEditorial', '2016', 152, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=looks&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Most recent analysis has focused on model outputs (e.g., language model surprisal) or internal vector representations (e.g., probing classifiers). Complementary to these works, we propose methods for analyzing the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models and apply them to BERT. BERT’s attention heads exhibit patterns such as attending to delimiter tokens, specific positional offsets, or broadly attending over the whole sentence, with heads in the same layer often exhibiting similar behaviors. We further show that certain attention heads correspond well to linguistic notions of syntax and coreference. For example, we find heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT’s attention.', '2019', 591, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=look&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Bartolini, I. Vitali, C. Cadilhac, S. Hippenmeyer, L. Nguyen, A. Dayer, D. Jabaudon', 'Origins of neuronal diversity Although the main task of a neuroprogenitor is to produce more cells, it may not always produce the same cells. Some progenitors produce different daughter neurons as an embryo develops. Concurrently, these daughter neurons are also transitioning through states toward maturation. Telley et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the transcriptional identity of cells early in mouse brain development. As a neuroprogenitor transitioned to new states, it produced daughter neurons that reflect those new states. The neurons own postmitotic differentiation program is apparently overlaid onto these parentally supplied programs, driving emergence of specialized neuronal cell types in the neocortex. Science, this issue p. eaav2522 During corticogenesis in the brain, temporally dynamic molecular birthmarks in progenitors act as seeds for later neuronal diversity. INTRODUCTION The cerebral cortex is a cellularly heterogeneous structure whose neuronal circuits underlie high-order cognitive and sensorimotor information processing. Neocortical neuronal diversity emerges from interactions between intrinsic genetic programs and environment-derived signals, but how these processes unfold and interact in the developing brain is still unclear. During embryogenesis, distinct subtypes of glutamatergic neurons are sequentially born and differentiate from progenitors located in the ventricular zone below the cortex. The aggregate neurogenic competence of these ventricular zone progenitors (i.e., apical progenitors) hence progresses as corticogenesis proceeds, and temporal molecular patterning is thought to be a driving force for this process. Such temporal patterning is an evolutionarily conserved strategy to generate neuronal diversity, but in contrast to Drosophila, in which key molecules of temporal specification have been identified, how this occurs in mammals remains poorly understood. RATIONALE Although the cell type diversity of the adult neocortex is increasingly well characterized, how pre- and postmitotic developmental molecular programs unfold and interact during development remains unknown. This in part reflects our limited ability to assess molecular states at defined time points and in specific cell types with high temporal resolution. Here, we overcame this obstacle by combining FlashTag, a method to pulse-label isochronic cohorts of ventricular zone–born neurons and their mother cells, with single-cell RNA sequencing. Using this approach, we traced the transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical progenitors and their respective daughter neurons in mice from embryonic day 12 to day 15, as layer 6, 5, 4, and 2/3 neurons are successively generated. RESULTS Using temporal analysis of apical progenitor molecular states, we identified a core set of evolutionarily conserved, temporally patterned genes that sequentially unfold during development. These dynamically expressed genes drive apical progenitors from internally directed (“introverted”) to more exteroceptive (“extraverted”) states. Initially, cell cycle–related and nucleus/chromatin–related processes are prominent activities. Later in development, the susceptibility of apical progenitors to environmental signals increases, as highlighted by increased expression of membrane receptors, cell-cell signaling–related proteins, and excitability-related proteins. Temporally patterned genes are transmitted from apical progenitors to their neuronal progeny as successive ground states, onto which essentially conserved early postmitotic differentiation programs are applied. This process is evolutionarily conserved, because in human embryos, the transcriptional dynamics of the orthologs of this gene set are recapitulated in apical progenitors and their daughter neurons. Whereas acquisition of ground states by daughter neurons is largely environment-independent, cell-extrinsic processes come into play at later stages to sculpt final identity, as demonstrated by the progressive loss of apical progenitor–derived molecular birthmarks and the emergence of input-dependent transcriptional programs. This was particularly striking for differentiating layer 4 neurons, whose postnatal development strongly depends on synaptic input, suggesting that environmental sensibility may be prefigured prior to sensory experience. Finally, using a loss-of-function approach, we demonstrate that the temporal progression in apical progenitor states is epigenetically regulated by the Polycomb repressor complex PRC2, such that loss of PRC2 leads to an acceleration of apical progenitor neurogenic competence, as revealed by precocious generation of normally later-born cell types. CONCLUSION Our work provides a functional account of molecular programs at play in apical progenitors and their daughter neurons during corticogenesis in mice, and reveals that epigenetically regulated temporal molecular birthmarks in apical progenitors act in their postmitotic progeny as seeds for neuronal diversity. Conserved differentiation programs, together with later-occurring environment-dependent signals, then act on these sequential ground states to drive newborn neurons toward their final, cell type–specific identities. Temporal molecular patterning in the mouse neocortex. Evolutionarily conserved, temporally patterned genes drive apical progenitors from internally directed to exteroceptive states. The PRC2 complex epigenetically drives this progression (not shown). Embryonic age–dependent molecular marks are transmitted from apical progenitors to newborn neurons as successive ground states, onto which essentially conserved differentiation programs are applied, together with later-occurring environment-dependent signals. Thus, temporal molecular birthmarks in progenitors act in their postmitotic progeny to seed adult neuronal diversity. During corticogenesis, distinct subtypes of neurons are sequentially born from ventricular zone progenitors. How these cells are molecularly temporally patterned is poorly understood. We used single-cell RNA sequencing at high temporal resolution to trace the lineage of the molecular identities of successive generations of apical progenitors (APs) and their daughter neurons in mouse embryos. We identified a core set of evolutionarily conserved, temporally patterned genes that drive APs from internally driven to more exteroceptive states. We found that the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically regulates AP temporal progression. Embryonic age–dependent AP molecular states are transmitted to their progeny as successive ground states, onto which essentially conserved early postmitotic differentiation programs are applied, and are complemented by later-occurring environment-dependent signals. Thus, epigenetically regulated temporal molecular birthmarks present in progenitors act in their postmitotic progeny to seed adult neuronal diversity.', '2019', 140, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=daughter&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Unexpectedly, the cartwheel grows from its proximal end, and Plk4 determines both the rate and period of centriole growth: the more active the centriolar Plk4, the faster centrioles grow, but the faster centriolar Plk4 is inactivated and growth ceases. Thus, Plk4 functions as a homeostatic clock, establishing an inverse relationship between growth rate and period to ensure that daughter centrioles grow to the correct size.', '2018', 46, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=daughter&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Furthermore, the amount of time daughter cells spend in quiescence is correlated with the extent of inherited damage. Our study thus links replication errors in one cell cycle to the fate of daughter cells in the subsequent cell cycle.

Stem cell niches provide signals that promote stem cell maintenance, while differentiated daughter cells are known to provide feedback signals to regulate stem cell replication and differentiation. Recently, stem cells have been shown to regulate themselves using an autocrine mechanism. The existence of a ‘stem cell niche’ was first postulated by Schofield in 1978 to define local environments necessary for the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells. Since then, an increasing body of work has focused on defining stem cell niches. Yet little is known about how progenitor cell and differentiated cell numbers and proportions are maintained. In the airway epithelium, basal cells function as stem/progenitor cells that can both self-renew and produce differentiated secretory cells and ciliated cells. Secretory cells also act as transit-amplifying cells that eventually differentiate into post-mitotic ciliated cells . Here we describe a mode of cell regulation in which adult mammalian stem/progenitor cells relay a forward signal to their own progeny. Surprisingly, this forward signal is shown to be necessary for daughter cell maintenance. Using a combination of cell ablation, lineage tracing and signalling pathway modulation, we show that airway basal stem/progenitor cells continuously supply a Notch ligand to their daughter secretory cells. Without these forward signals, the secretory progenitor cell pool fails to be maintained and secretory cells execute a terminal differentiation program and convert into ciliated cells.

We found that manipulations that prevent daughter centriole formation or induce its separation from the mother abolish ciliogenesis. This defect was caused by stabilization of the negative ciliogenesis regulator CP110 and was corrected by CP110 depletion. CP110 dysregulation may be caused by effects on Neurl-4, a daughter centriole–associated ubiquitin ligase cofactor, which was required for ciliogenesis. Centrosome-targeted Neurl-4 was sufficient to restore ciliogenesis in cells with manipulated daughter centrioles. Interestingly, early during ciliogenesis, Neurl-4 transiently associated with the mother centriole in a process that required mother–daughter centriole proximity.

Centriole numbers are tightly regulated, and daughter centrioles (which assemble in S phase) cannot themselves duplicate or organize centrosomes until they have passed through mitosis. It is unclear how this mitotic “centriole conversion” is regulated, but it requires Plk1/Polo kinase. Here we show that in flies, Cdk1 phosphorylates the conserved centriole protein Sas-4 during mitosis. This creates a Polo-docking site that helps recruit Polo to daughter centrioles and is required for the subsequent recruitment of Asterless (Asl), a protein essential for centriole duplication and mitotic centrosome assembly. Point mutations in Sas-4 that prevent Cdk1 phosphorylation or Polo docking do not block centriole disengagement during mitosis, but block efficient centriole conversion and lead to embryonic lethality.

Girls who were encouraged to diet by both parents were 8 times more likely to report early dieting than girls who were not. Neither maternal nor paternal encouragement predicted the emergence of dieting during adolescence. Girls who dieted and had parental encouragement to do so had increases in BMI percentile from 9 y to 15 y. Findings reveal that parental encouragement to diet may be counterproductive and that parents need alternative approaches to promote healthy patterns of intake and growth among young girls.', '2014', 42, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=daughters&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

Zapata, Elena Reyes', 'PURPOSE\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer. Little is known about correlates of HPV vaccination among Hispanic adolescents living in the United States. The purpose of this study was to (1) examine relationships between both U.S./American and Latina acculturation and variables typically associated with HPV vaccine uptake (e.g., physician recommendation); and (2) identify predictors of HPV vaccine uptake among daughters of Latina mothers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLatina mothers (N = 200) recruited from a Federally Qualified Health Center serving low-income families in Florida completed a semistructured interview that assessed awareness of and knowledge about HPV and HPV-vaccines, vaccination beliefs, whether their daughters physician had recommended the HPV vaccine, health history, U.S./American and Latina acculturation, mother and daughter demographics, and daughters HPV vaccination status.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOnly 18% of daughters had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Higher levels of U.S./American acculturation were associated with greater odds of vaccine uptake and other common predictors of HPV vaccination (e.g., physician recommendation, vaccine awareness). A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent predictors of vaccine uptake: physician recommendation, daughters age, and low worry about how to pay for the vaccine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite generally favorable views of HPV vaccination, observed rates of vaccine uptake in this sample were substantially lower than national estimates. Latina mothers who are more integrated into U.S. society may be more likely to vaccinate their daughters against HPV.

Kendell', 'The Trivers-Willard hypothesis predicts the unequal parental investment between daughters and sons, depending on maternal condition and offspring reproductive potential. Specifically, in polygynous populations where males have higher reproductive variance than females, it predicts that mothers in good condition will invest more in sons, whereas mothers in poor condition will invest more in daughters. Previous studies testing this hypothesis focused on behavioral investment, whereas few examined biological investment. This study investigates the Trivers-Willard hypothesis on both behavioral and biological parental investment by examining breastfeeding frequencies and breast milk fat concentrations. Data from exclusively breastfeeding mothers in Northern Kenya were used to test hypotheses: Economically sufficient mothers will breastfeed sons more frequently than daughters, whereas poor mothers will breastfeed daughters more frequently than sons, and economically sufficient mothers will produce breast milk with higher fat concentration for sons than daughters, whereas poor mothers will produce breast milk with higher fat concentration for daughters than sons. Linear regression models were applied, using breastfeeding frequency or log-transformed milk fat as the dependent variable, and offsprings sex (son = 1/daughter = 0), socioeconomic status (higher = 1/lower = 0), and the sex-wealth interaction as the predictors, controlling for covariates. Our results only supported the milk fat hypothesis: infants sex and socioeconomic status interacted (P = 0.014, n = 72) in their relation with milk fat concentration. The model estimated that economically sufficient mothers produced richer milk for sons than daughters (2.8 vs. 1.74 gm/dl) [corrected] while poor mothers produced richer milk for daughters than sons (2.6 vs. 2.3 gm/dl).

Associations between maternal pregnancy experience and daughters’ age at menarche are not well understood. We examined whether maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) were independently related to daughters’ age at menarche. Consistent with a life course perspective, we also examined whether maternal GWG, birth weight, and prepubertal BMI mediated the relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and daughter’s menarcheal age. We examined 2,497 mother-daughter pairs from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Survival analysis with Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate whether maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) and GWG adequacy (inadequate, recommended, and excessive) were associated with risk for earlier menarche among girls, controlling for important covariates. Analyses were conducted to examine the mediating roles of GWG adequacy, child birth weight and prepubertal BMI. Adjusting for covariates, pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (HR = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.06, 1.36) and excess GWG (HR = 1.13, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.27) were associated with daughters’ earlier menarche, while inadequate GWG was not. The association between maternal pre-pregnancy weight and daughters’ menarcheal timing was not mediated by daughter’s birth weight, prepubertal BMI or maternal GWG.

However, the mechanism behind this interesting discovery has not been elucidated. Here, we firstly applied the combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to the P. stutzeri 273 wild type and merF deletion mutant. The results showed that expressions of extracellular flagellar components and FliS, a key factor controlling the biogenesis of extracellular flagellar filament, were significantly down-regulated in the merF deletion mutant. In combination of genetic and biochemical methods, MerF was further demonstrated to regulate the expression of fliS via directly binding to its promoter, which is consistent with the discovery that MerF is essential for bacterial flagellum biogenesis and motility. Importantly, the expression of merF and fliS could be simultaneously up-regulated by different heavy metals and MerF homologs exist in both bacterial and archaeal domains.

To alleviate this issue, this study developed a highly computationally efficient non-hydrostatic ocean model named MERF v3.0 (the third version of the Marine Environment Research and Forecasting model) in which a semi-implicit and variable layers (SIVL) scheme is proposed for dynamic pressure calculation. The SIVL scheme provides freedom to choose the ratio between the number of dynamic pressure layers and the number of velocity layers as required. Moreover, the model adopted numerical calculation framework OpenArray and PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) to achieve implicit parallelism and a concise code structure. Five classical numerical experiments were performed to validate the simulation capacity of this non-hydrostatic ocean model, including the standing wave in a closed basin, surface solitary wave, lock-exchange problem, periodic wave over a bar and tidally induced internal lee wave. The numerical simulation results are consistent with the analytical solutions and experimental data published in the literature.

These results are consistent with the suite of adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle and piscivorous diet that have previously been documented for Spinosaurus 7 , 13 , 14 . Although developed to a lesser degree, aquatic adaptations are also found in other members of the spinosaurid clade 15 , 16 , which had a near-global distribution and a stratigraphic range of more than 50 million years 14 , pointing to a substantial invasion of aquatic environments by dinosaurs.

Combining climate and ecological modeling tools, we demonstrate a substantial detrimental effect on dinosaur habitats caused by an impact winter scenario triggered by the Chicxulub asteroid. We were not able to obtain such an extinction state with several modeling scenarios of Deccan volcanism. We further show that the concomitant prolonged eruption of the Deccan traps might have acted as an ameliorating agent, buffering the negative effects on climate and global ecosystems that the asteroid impact produced at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. The Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction, 66 Ma, included the demise of non-avian dinosaurs. Intense debate has focused on the relative roles of Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub asteroid impact as kill mechanisms for this event. Here, we combine fossil-occurrence data with paleoclimate and habitat suitability models to evaluate dinosaur habitability in the wake of various asteroid impact and Deccan volcanism scenarios. Asteroid impact models generate a prolonged cold winter that suppresses potential global dinosaur habitats. Conversely, long-term forcing from Deccan volcanism (carbon dioxide [CO2]-induced warming) leads to increased habitat suitability. Short-term (aerosol cooling) volcanism still allows equatorial habitability. These results support the asteroid impact as the main driver of the non-avian dinosaur extinction. By contrast, induced warming from volcanism mitigated the most extreme effects of asteroid impact, potentially reducing the extinction severity.', '2020', 29, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaur&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Statistical evaluation of in situ Raman spectra obtained for a representative set of hard- and soft-shelled, fossil and extant diapsid eggshells clusters the originally organic but secondarily phosphatized Protoceratops and the organic Mussaurus eggshells with soft, non-biomineralized eggshells. Histology corroborates the organic composition of these soft-shelled dinosaur eggs, revealing a stratified arrangement resembling turtle soft eggshell. Through an ancestral-state reconstruction of composition and ultrastructure, we compare eggshells from Protoceratops and Mussaurus with those from other diapsids, revealing that the first dinosaur egg was soft-shelled. The calcified, hard-shelled dinosaur egg evolved independently at least three times throughout the Mesozoic era, explaining the bias towards eggshells of derived dinosaurs in the fossil record. Molecular analyses of newly discovered, embryo-bearing ornithischian and sauropod dinosaur eggs suggest that the ancestral dinosaur egg was soft-shelled, and that hard-shelled eggs evolved independently at least three times in the major dinosaur lineages.', '2020', 18, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaur&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

However, a continent-wide projection demonstrates habitat stability, or even a Campanian-to-Maastrichtian increase, that is not preserved. This reduction of the spatial sampling window resulted from formation of the proto-Rocky Mountains and sea-level regression.

For dinosaurs, the most parsimonious inference yields a thick, hard shelled egg, so richly represented in the Late Cretaceous fossil record.

This thin shell layer strongly contrasts with the considerably thicker calcareous shells of Late Jurassic dinosaurs. Phylogenetic analyses and their Sinemurian age indicate that the thin eggshell of basal sauropodomorphs represents a major evolutionary innovation at the base of Dinosauria and that the much thicker eggshell of sauropods, theropods, and ornithischian dinosaurs evolved independently.

We use non-uniform macroevolutionary models based on Ornstein–Uhlenbeck and trend processes to unify these observations, asking: what patterns of evolutionary rates, directionality and constraint explain the diversification of dinosaur body mass? We find that dinosaur evolution is constrained by attraction to discrete body size optima that undergo rare, but abrupt, evolutionary shifts. This model explains both the rarity of multi-lineage directional trends, and the occurrence of abrupt directional excursions during the origins of groups such as tiny pygostylian birds and giant sauropods. Most expansion of trait space results from rare, constraint-breaking innovations in just a small number of lineages. These lineages shifted rapidly into novel regions of trait space, occasionally to small sizes, but most often to large or giant sizes. As with Cenozoic mammals, intermediate body sizes were typically attained only transiently by lineages on a trajectory from small to large size.

Our evidence comes from a combined analysis of skeletal evidence and footprint occurrences, and especially from the exquisitely dated ichnofaunas of the Italian Dolomites. These provide evidence of tetrapod faunal compositions through the Carnian and Norian, and show that dinosaur footprints appear exactly at the time of the CPE.

Nesbitt', 'Significance Birds—the fastest growing terrestrial vertebrates—develop unlike all other living reptiles. As part of this postnatal developmental mode, birds possess a low amount of intraspecific variation, and the timing of the origin of this low variation is poorly constrained. By studying well-sampled growth series of nonavian dinosaurs and their closest relatives, we were able to identify this transition within Mesozoic theropod dinosaurs. Surprisingly, the earliest dinosaurs and their close relatives possessed an extremely high amount of variation, higher than either crocodylians or birds. This high variation is the ancestral dinosaurian scheme and was lost in more derived nonavian theropods, including Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. High variation could have contributed to the rise of dinosaurian dominance during the Triassic–Jurassic mass extinction. Compared with all other living reptiles, birds grow extremely fast and possess unusually low levels of intraspecific variation during postnatal development. It is now clear that birds inherited their high rates of growth from their dinosaurian ancestors, but the origin of the avian condition of low variation during development is poorly constrained. The most well-understood growth trajectories of later Mesozoic theropods (e.g., Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus) show similarly low variation to birds, contrasting with higher variation in extant crocodylians. Here, we show that deep within Dinosauria, among the earliest-diverging dinosaurs, anomalously high intraspecific variation is widespread but then is lost in more derived theropods. This style of development is ancestral for dinosaurs and their closest relatives, and, surprisingly, this level of variation is far higher than in living crocodylians. Among early dinosaurs, this variation is widespread across Pangaea in the Triassic and Early Jurassic, and among early-diverging theropods (ceratosaurs), this variation is maintained for 165 million years to the end of the Cretaceous. Because the Late Triassic environment across Pangaea was volatile and heterogeneous, this variation may have contributed to the rise of dinosaurian dominance through the end of the Triassic Period.', '2016', 46, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Recent studies on geckos suggest that active tail stabilization occurs during climbing, righting and gliding. By contrast, studies on the effect of lizard tail loss show evidence of a decrease, an increase or no change in performance. Application of a control-theoretic framework could advance our general understanding of inertial appendage use in locomotion. Here we report that lizards control the swing of their tails in a measured manner to redirect angular momentum from their bodies to their tails, stabilizing body attitude in the sagittal plane. We video-recorded Red-Headed Agama lizards (Agama agama) leaping towards a vertical surface by first vaulting onto an obstacle with variable traction to induce a range of perturbations in body angular momentum. To examine a known controlled tail response, we built a lizard-sized robot with an active tail that used sensory feedback to stabilize pitch as it drove off a ramp. Our dynamics model revealed that a body swinging its tail experienced less rotation than a body with a rigid tail, a passively compliant tail or no tail. To compare a range of tails, we calculated tail effectiveness as the amount of tailless body rotation a tail could stabilize. A model Velociraptor mongoliensis supported the initial tail stabilization hypothesis, showing as it did a greater tail effectiveness than the Agama lizards.

The question boils down to whether dinosaurs had energetic systems closer to those of rapidly metabolizing mammals and birds, or to those of slower reptiles that do not internally regulate their body temperature. However, determining the metabolic rate of extinct organisms is no easy task. Grady et al. analyzed a huge data set on growth rate in both extinct and living species, using a method that considers body temperature and body size. Dinosaur metabolism seems to have been neither fast nor slow, but somewhere in the middle—so, dinosaurs did not fully regulate their internal temperature but they were also not entirely at the whim of the environment; neither slow goliaths nor supercharged reptiles. Science, this issue p. 1268 Analysis of animal growth energetics indicates that dinosaurs had intermediate metabolic rates and elevated but labile temperatures. Were dinosaurs ectotherms or fast-metabolizing endotherms whose activities were unconstrained by temperature? To date, some of the strongest evidence for endothermy comes from the rapid growth rates derived from the analysis of fossil bones. However, these studies are constrained by a lack of comparative data and an appropriate energetic framework. Here we compile data on ontogenetic growth for extant and fossil vertebrates, including all major dinosaur clades. Using a metabolic scaling approach, we find that growth and metabolic rates follow theoretical predictions across clades, although some groups deviate. Moreover, when the effects of size and temperature are considered, dinosaur metabolic rates were intermediate to those of endotherms and ectotherms and closest to those of extant mesotherms.

Soil incubated in the laboratory at 60% WFP supported maximum aerobic microbial activity as determined by CO production and O uptake. In the field, % WFP of surface no-tillage soils (0–75 mm) at four U.S. locations averaged 62% at time of sampling, whereas that for plowed soils was 44%. This difference in % WFP was reflected in 3.4 and 9.4 times greater CO and NO production, respectively, from surface no-tillage soils over a 24-h period as compared to plowed soils. At a depth of 75 to 150 mm, % WFP values increased in both no-tillage and plowed soils, averaging approximately 70% for no tillage compared with 50 to 60% for plowed soils. Production of CO in the plowed soils was enhanced by the increased % WFP, resulting in little or no difference in CO production between tillage treatments. Nitrous oxide production, however, remained greater under no-tillage conditions. Substantially greater amounts of NO were produced from the N-fertilized soils, regardless of tillage practice. Production of CO and NO was primarily related to the % WFP of tillage treatments although, in several instances, soil-water-soluble C and NO levels were important as well. Calculations of relative aerobic microbial activity between no-tillage and plowed soils, based on differences in % WFP relative to maximum activity at 60%, indicated linear relationships for CO and NO production between WFP values of 30 to 70%. Below 60% WFP, water limits microbial activity, but above 60%, aerobic microbial activity decreases—apparently the result of reduced aeration.', '1984', 2017, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=illinois&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Steam condensation in the power generation cycle creates a need for cooling, often accomplished using large amounts of water. These large water requirements can lead to negative consequences of power plants dialing down or shutting down during times of low water availability. Consequently, water constraints can translate into energy constraints. Projected future population growth and changing climate conditions might also increase the competition for water in many areas, motivating a resource accounting analysis to both establish a baseline of current water requirements and simulate possible impacts from future water and energy management decisions. Our analysis of the current water demands for power generation, focused on the state of Illinois, combined existing digital spatial datasets with engineering basic principles to synthesize a geographic information systems (GIS) model of current and projected water demand for thermoelectric power plants. We evaluated two potential future cases based on water use implications: (1) a shift in fuel from coal to natural gas, and (2) a shift in cooling technology from open-loop to closed-loop cooling. Our results show that a shift from coal-generated to natural gas-generated electricity could decrease statewide water consumption by 0.10billionm3/yr (32% decrease) and withdrawal by 7.9billionm3/yr (37% decrease), on average. A shift from open-loop to closed-loop cooling technologies could decrease withdrawals by an average of 21billionm3/yr (96% decrease), with the tradeoff of increasing statewide water consumption for power generation by 0.18billionm3/yr (58% increase). Furthermore, we performed an economic analysis of retrofitting open-loop cooling systems to closed-loop cooling, revealing an annual cost between $0.58 and $1.3billion to retrofit the 22 open-loop cooling plants considered, translating to an effective water price between $0.03 and $0.06/m3.

Given the fact that pedestrians are more prone to higher injury severity levels compared to other road users, this study aims to investigate the risk factors associated with various levels of injury severity that pedestrians experience in Illinois.\n\n\nMETHOD\nOrdered-response models are used to analyze single-vehicle, single-pedestrian crash data from 2010 to 2013 in Illinois. As a measure of net change in the effect of significant variables, average direct pseudo-elasticities are calculated that can be further used to prioritize safety countermeasures. A model comparison using AIC and BIC is also provided to compare the performance of the studied ordered-response models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results recognized many variables associated with severe injuries: older pedestrians (more than 65years old), pedestrians not wearing contrasting clothing, adult drivers (16-24), drunk drivers, time of day (20:00 to 05:00), divided highways, multilane highways, darkness, and heavy vehicles. On the other hand, crossing the street at crosswalks, older drivers (more than 65years old), urban areas, and presence of traffic control devices (signal and sign) are associated with decreased probability of severe injuries.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\nThe comparison between three proposed ordered-response models shows that the partial proportional odds (PPO) model outperforms the conventional ordered (proportional odds-PO) model and generalized ordered logit model (GOLM). Based on the findings, stricter rules to address DUI driving is suggested. Educational programs need to focus on older pedestrians given the increasing number of older people in Illinois in the upcoming years.

This reduces the workload on individual experts and also gives a better estimate of the unobserved ground truth. When experts disagree, the standard approaches are to treat the majority opinion as the correct label or to model the correct label as a distribution. These approaches, however, do not make any use of potentially valuable information about which expert produced which label. To make use of this extra information, we propose modeling the experts individually and then learning averaging weights for combining them, possibly in sample-specific ways. This allows us to give more weight to more reliable experts and take advantage of the unique strengths of individual experts at classifying certain types of data.

Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews (conducted between 2010 and 2012) that were, conducted against a background of longer-term participant-observation, ethnographic studies of street-based drug users and dealers in Philadelphia (2007-12) and San Francisco (1994-2007, 2012). Philadelphia and San Francisco were selected for their contrasting political economies, immigration patterns and source type of heroin. In Philadelphia the ethnographers found heroin injectors, usually white users, who had started their opiate using careers with prescription opioids rather than transitioning from other drugs. In both Philadelphia and San Francisco, most of the young heroin injectors interviewed began, their drug-use trajectories with opioid pills--usually Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen), generic short acting oxycodone or, OxyContin (long-acting oxycodone)--before transitioning to heroin, usually by nasal inhalation (sniffing) or smoking at first, followed by injecting. While most of the Philadelphia users were born in the city or its suburbs and had started using both opioid pills and heroin there, many of the San Francisco users had initiated their pill and sometimes heroin use elsewhere and had migrated to the city from around the country. Nevertheless, patterns of transition of younger injectors were similar in both cities suggesting an evolving national pattern. In contrast, older users in both Philadelphia and San Francisco were more likely to have graduated to heroin injection from non-opiate drugs such as cannabis, methamphetamine and cocaine. Pharmaceutical opioid initiates typically reported switching to heroin for reasons of cost and ease-of-access to supply after becoming physically and emotionally dependent on opioid pills. Many expressed surprise and dismay at their progression to sniffing and subsequently to injecting heroin. Historically and structurally these users found themselves caught at the intersection of two major developments in the opiate supply: (1) an over 500% increase in opiate pill prescription from 1997 to 2005 resulting in easy access to diverted supplies of less stigmatized opiates than heroin and (2) a heroin supply glut, following the US entry of Colombian-sourced, heroin in the early 1990s, that decreased cost and increased purity at the retail level. A nationwide up-cycle of heroin use may be occurring among young inner city, suburban and rural youth fueled by widespread prescription opioid pill use.', '2014', 353, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Schober', 'Correlation and agreement are 2 concepts that are widely applied in the medical literature and clinical practice to assess for the presence and strength of an association. However, because correlation and agreement are conceptually distinct, they require the use of different statistics. Agreement is a concept that is closely related to but fundamentally different from and often confused with correlation. The idea of agreement refers to the notion of reproducibility of clinical evaluations or biomedical measurements. The intraclass correlation coefficient is a commonly applied measure of agreement for continuous data. The intraclass correlation coefficient can be validly applied specifically to assess intrarater reliability and interrater reliability. As its name implies, the Lin concordance correlation coefficient is another measure of agreement or concordance. In undertaking a comparison of a new measurement technique with an established one, it is necessary to determine whether they agree sufficiently for the new to replace the old. Bland and Altman demonstrated that using a correlation coefficient is not appropriate for assessing the interchangeability of 2 such measurement methods. They in turn described an alternative approach, the since widely applied graphical Bland–Altman Plot, which is based on a simple estimation of the mean and standard deviation of differences between measurements by the 2 methods. In reading a medical journal article that includes the interpretation of diagnostic tests and application of diagnostic criteria, attention is conventionally focused on aspects like sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. However, if the clinicians who interpret the test cannot agree on its interpretation and resulting typically dichotomous or binary diagnosis, the test results will be of little practical use. Such agreement between observers (interobserver agreement) about a dichotomous or binary variable is often reported as the kappa statistic. Assessing the interrater agreement between observers, in the case of ordinal variables and data, also has important biomedical applicability. Typically, this situation calls for use of the Cohen weighted kappa. Questionnaires, psychometric scales, and diagnostic tests are widespread and increasingly used by not only researchers but also clinicians in their daily practice. It is essential that these questionnaires, scales, and diagnostic tests have a high degree of agreement between observers. It is therefore vital that biomedical researchers and clinicians apply the appropriate statistical measures of agreement to assess the reproducibility and quality of these measurement instruments and decision-making processes.', '2018', 25, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Fast-time duskside SAPS/RC injections appear intimately related to a two-loop circuit of the substorm current wedge (SCW2L).

These pills, which look like known opioids or benzodiazepines, have introduced synthetic opioids to more unsuspecting customers. As soon as these drugs are regulated by various countries, new compounds quickly appear on the market, making detection difficult and the number of cases likely underreported. Standard targeted analytical techniques such as GC-MS (gas chromatography mass spectrometry) and LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) can detect these drugs, but novel compound identification is aided by nontargeted testing with LC-HRMS (liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry). Fentanyl, fentanyl analogs and other novel synthetic opioids are all full agonists of varying potencies at the μ-opioid receptor, leading to typical clinical effects of miosis and respiratory and central nervous system depression. Due to their high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, larger doses of naloxone are required to reverse the effects than are commonly used. Synthetic opioids are an increasingly major public health threat requiring vigilance from multiple fields including law enforcement, government agencies, clinical chemists, pharmacists, and physicians, to name a few, in order to stem its tide.

This report describes trends in drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl by demographic characteristics and geographic regions from 2011 through 2016. Methods-Drug overdose deaths were identified from the National Vital Statistics System-Mortality (NVSS-M) multiple cause-of-death files (2011-2016) using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision underlying causes of death (codes X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, or Y10-Y14). NVSS-M records for drug overdose deaths were linked with literal text from death certificates. Drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl were identified using a methodology established collaboratively by the National Center for Health Statistics and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-referred to as the Drugs Mentioned with Involvement (DMI) methodology-supplemented with search terms identified using text analytics software. Fentanyl involvement was determined by the presence of any string term or phrase listing fentanyl, or any fentanyl metabolite, precursor, analog, or misspelling identified in the death certificate literal text fields (i.e., the causes of death from Part I, significant conditions contributing to death from Part II, and a description of how the injury occurred). Trends were evaluated using the National Cancer Institutes Joinpoint Regression Program. Results-The number of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl was stable in 2011 (1,663) and 2012 (1,615), and began to increase in 2013, rising to 18,335 deaths in 2016. The ageadjusted rate increased from 0.5 per 100,000 standard population in 2011 to 5.9 per 100,000 in 2016, with the increase starting in 2013 (0.6 in 2013 to 1.3 in 2014 and 2.6 in 2015).

First, fentanyl vaccine administration significantly blunted fentanyl reinforcement and increased food reinforcement for 15 weeks in non-opioid dependent rats. Second, surmountability experiments by increasing the unit fentanyl dose available during the self-administration session 10-fold empirically determined that the fentanyl vaccine produced an approximate 22-fold potency shift in fentanyl-vs.-food choice that was as effective as the clinically approved treatment naltrexone. Clonidine treatment significantly increased fentanyl-vs.-food choice. Lastly, fentanyl vaccine administration prevented the expression of withdrawal-associated increases in fentanyl-vs.-food choice following introduction of extended 12 h fentanyl access sessions.

This review analyzes the factors that triggered the opioid crisis and its further evolution, along with the interventions to manage and prevent opioid use disorder (OUD), which are fundamental for curtailing the opioid crisis. Observations Opioid drugs are among the most powerful analgesics but also among the most addictive. The current opioid crisis, initially triggered by overprescription of opioid analgesics, which facilitated their diversion and misuse, has now expanded to heroin and illicit synthetic opioids (fentanyl and its analogues), the potency of which further increases their addictiveness and lethality. Although there are effective medications to treat OUD (methadone hydrochloride, buprenorphine, and naltrexone hydrochloride), these medications are underused, and the risk of relapse is still high. Strategies to expand medication use and treatment retention include greater involvement of health care professionals (including psychiatrists) and approaches to address comorbidities. In particular, the high prevalence of depression and suicidality among patients with OUD, if untreated, contributes to relapse and increases the risk of overdose fatalities. Prevention interventions include screening and early detection of psychiatric disorders, which increase the risk of substance use disorders, including OUD. Conclusions and Relevance Although overprescription of opioid medications triggered the opioid crisis, improving opioid prescription practices for pain management, although important for addressing the opioid crisis, is no longer sufficient. In parallel, strategies to expand access to medication for OUD and improve treatment retention, including a more active involvement of psychiatrists who are optimally trained to address psychiatric comorbidities, are fundamental to preventing fatalities and achieving recovery.

Opioid tolerance (increased dose needed for analgesia) and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (paradoxical increase in pain with opioid administration) can contribute to both poorly controlled pain and dose escalation. Hyperalgesia is particularly problematic as further opioid prescribing is largely futile. The mechanisms of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia are complex, involving μ opioid receptor signalling pathways that offer opportunities for novel analgesic alternatives. The intracellular scaffold protein β-arrestin-2 is implicated in tolerance, hyperalgesia, and other opioid side-effects. Development of agonists biased against recruitment of β-arrestin-2 could provide analgesic efficacy with fewer side-effects. Alternative approaches include inhibition of peripheral μ opioid receptors and blockade of downstream signalling mechanisms, such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, it is prudent to use multimodal analgesic regimens to reduce reliance on opioids during the perioperative period.

We have previously shown that desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor and interaction with β-arrestins is controlled by carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation. Here we created knockin mice with a series of serine- and threonine-to-alanine mutations that render the receptor increasingly unable to recruit β-arrestins. Desensitization is inhibited in locus coeruleus neurons of mutant mice. Opioid-induced analgesia is strongly enhanced and analgesic tolerance is greatly diminished.

Objective To examine the association between index dental opioid prescriptions from dental clinicians for opioid-naive adolescents and young adults in 2015 and new persistent use and subsequent diagnoses of abuse in this population. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study examined outpatient opioid prescriptions for patients aged 16 to 25 years in the Optum Research Database in 2015. Prescriptions were linked by National Provider Identifier number to a clinician category. Exposures Individuals were included in the index dental opioid (opioid-exposed) cohort if they filled an opioid prescription from a dental clinician in 2015, had continuous health plan coverage and no record of opioid prescriptions for 12 months before receiving the prescription, and had 12 months of health plan coverage after receiving the prescription. Two age- and sex-matched opioid-nonexposed control individuals were selected for each opioid-exposed individual and were assigned a corresponding phantom prescription date. Main Outcomes and Measures Receipt of an opioid prescription within 90 to 365 days, a health care encounter diagnosis associated with opioid abuse within 365 days, and all-cause mortality within 365 days of the index opioid or phantom prescription date. Results Among 754 002 individuals with continuous enrollment in 2015, 97 462 patients (12.9%) received 1 or more opioid prescriptions, of whom 29 791 (30.6%) received prescriptions supplied by a dental clinician. The opioid-exposed cohort included 14 888 participants (7882 women [52.9%], 11 273 white [75.7%], with mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.4] years), and the randomly selected opioid-nonexposed cohort included 29 776 participants (15 764 women [52.9%], 20 078 [67.4%] white, with mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.4] years). Among the 14 888 individuals in the index dental opioid cohort, 1021 (6.9%) received another opioid prescription 90 to 365 days later compared with 30 of 29 776 (0.1%) opioid-nonexposed controls (adjusted absolute risk difference, 6.8%; 95% CI, 6.3%-7.2%), and 866 opioid-exposed individuals (5.8%) experienced 1 or more subsequent health care encounters with an opioid abuse–related diagnosis compared with 115 opioid-nonexposed controls (0.4%) (adjusted absolute risk difference, 5.3%; 95% CI, 5.0%-5.7%). There was only 1 death in each cohort. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that a substantial proportion of adolescents and young adults are exposed to opioids through dental clinicians.

Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.\n\n\nPROCESS\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category.\n\n\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS\nEvidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThere are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nThe guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.', '2016', 3278, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=opioids&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 18),

Objective To systematically review randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of opioids for chronic noncancer pain. Data Sources and Study Selection The databases of CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, AMED, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to April 2018 for RCTs of opioids for chronic noncancer pain vs any nonopioid control. Data Extraction and Synthesis Paired reviewers independently extracted data. The analyses used random-effects models and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to rate the quality of the evidence. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were pain intensity (score range, 0-10 cm on a visual analog scale for pain; lower is better and the minimally important difference [MID] is 1 cm), physical functioning (score range, 0-100 points on the 36-item Short Form physical component score [SF-36 PCS]; higher is better and the MID is 5 points), and incidence of vomiting. Results Ninety-six RCTs including 26 169 participants (61% female; median age, 58 years [interquartile range, 51-61 years]) were included. Of the included studies, there were 25 trials of neuropathic pain, 32 trials of nociceptive pain, 33 trials of central sensitization (pain present in the absence of tissue damage), and 6 trials of mixed types of pain. Compared with placebo, opioid use was associated with reduced pain (weighted mean difference [WMD], −0.69 cm [95% CI, −0.82 to −0.56 cm] on a 10-cm visual analog scale for pain; modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 11.9% [95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%]), improved physical functioning (WMD, 2.04 points [95% CI, 1.41 to 2.68 points] on the 100-point SF-36 PCS; modeled risk difference for achieving the MID, 8.5% [95% CI, 5.9% to 11.2%]), and increased vomiting (5.9% with opioids vs 2.3% with placebo for trials that excluded patients with adverse events during a run-in period). Low- to moderate-quality evidence suggested similar associations of opioids with improvements in pain and physical functioning compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (pain: WMD, −0.60 cm [95% CI, −1.54 to 0.34 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, −0.90 points [95% CI, −2.69 to 0.89 points]), tricyclic antidepressants (pain: WMD, −0.13 cm [95% CI, −0.99 to 0.74 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, −5.31 points [95% CI, −13.77 to 3.14 points]), and anticonvulsants (pain: WMD, −0.90 cm [95% CI, −1.65 to −0.14 cm]; physical functioning: WMD, 0.45 points [95% CI, −5.77 to 6.66 points]). Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis of RCTs of patients with chronic noncancer pain, evidence from high-quality studies showed that opioid use was associated with statistically significant but small improvements in pain and physical functioning, and increased risk of vomiting compared with placebo.

Atluri, S. Aydin, S. Bakshi, R. Barkin', 'BACKGROUND\nOpioid use, abuse, and adverse consequences, including death, have escalated at an alarming rate since the 1990s. In an attempt to control opioid abuse, numerous regulations and guidelines for responsible opioid prescribing have been developed by various organizations. However, the US opioid epidemic is continuing and drug dose deaths tripled during 1999 to 2015. Recent data show a continuing increase in deaths due to natural and semisynthetic opioids, a decline in methadone deaths, and an explosive increase in the rates of deaths involving other opioids, specifically heroin and illicit synthetic fentanyl. Contrary to scientific evidence of efficacy and negative recommendations, a significant proportion of physicians and patients (92%) believe that opioids reduce pain and a smaller proportion (57%) report better quality of life. In preparation of the current guidelines, we have focused on the means to reduce the abuse and diversion of opioids without jeopardizing access for those patients suffering from non-cancer pain who have an appropriate medical indication for opioid use.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain, to develop a consistent philosophy among the many diverse groups with an interest in opioid use as to how appropriately prescribe opioids, to improve the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain and to reduce the likelihood of drug abuse and diversion. These guidelines are intended to provide a systematic and standardized approach to this complex and difficult arena of practice, while recognizing that every clinical situation is unique.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions. The methodology also utilized trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various specialties and groups. The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed, with a best evidence synthesis of the available literature, and utilized grading for recommendation as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).Summary of Recommendations:i.

Assessment of Effectiveness of Long-Term Opioid Therapy 11. Initiate opioid therapy with low dose, short-acting drugs, with appropriate monitoring. (Evidence: Level II; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) 12. Consider up to 40 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) as low dose, 41 to 90 MME as a moderate dose, and greater than 91 MME as high dose. (Evidence: Level II; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) 13. Avoid long-acting opioids for the initiation of opioid therapy. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) 14. Recommend methadone only for use after failure of other opioid therapy and only by clinicians with specific training in its risks and uses, within FDA recommended doses. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) 15. Understand and educate the patients of the effectiveness and adverse consequences. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) 16. Similar effectiveness for long-acting and short-acting opioids with increased adverse consequences of long-acting opioids. (Evidence: Level I-II; Strength of recommendation: Moderate to strong) 17. Periodically assess pain relief and/or functional status improvement of ≥ 30% without adverse consequences. (Evidence: Level II; Strength of recommendation: Moderate) 18. Recommend long-acting or high dose opioids only in specific circumstances with severe intractable pain. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong)iii. Monitoring for Adherence and Side Effects 19. Monitor for adherence, abuse, and noncompliance by UDT and PDMPs. (Evidence: Level I-II; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate to strong) 20. Monitor patients on methadone with an electrocardiogram periodically. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong). 21. Monitor for side effects including constipation and manage them appropriately, including discontinuation of opioids when indicated. (Evidence: Level I; Strength of Recommendation: Strong)iv. Final Phase 22. May continue with monitoring with continued medical necessity, with appropriate outcomes. (Evidence: Level I-II; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) 23. Discontinue opioid therapy for lack of response, adverse consequences, and abuse with rehabilitation. (Evidence: Level III; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines were developed based on comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among the panelists, in consonance with patient preferences, shared decision-making, and practice patterns with limited evidence, based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve pain and function in chronic non-cancer pain on a long-term basis. Consequently, chronic opioid therapy should be provided only to patients with proven medical necessity and stability with improvement in pain and function, independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events.Key words: Chronic pain, persistent pain, non-cancer pain, controlled substances, substance abuse, prescription drug abuse, dependency, opioids, prescription monitoring, drug testing, adherence monitoring, diversionDisclaimer: The guidelines are based on the best available evidence and do not constitute inflexible treatment recommendations.

('opioids', 6, 'Opioids and the immune system – friend or foe', 'Lisanne Mirja Plein, H. Rittner', 'Systemically administered opioids are among the most powerful analgesics for treating severe pain. Several negative side effects (respiratory depression, addiction, nausea and confusion) and the risk of opioid‐induced hyperalgesia accompany opioid administration. One other side effect is the potential of opioids to suppress the immune response and thereby to increase the vulnerability to infections. The link between opioids and immunosuppression has been investigated both in vitro and in vivo as well as in patients. However, the results are inconsistent: Exogenous opioids such as morphine and fentanyl have been found to impair the function of macrophages, natural killer cells and T‐cells and to weaken the gut barrier in vitro and in animal studies. In epidemiological studies, high doses and the initiation of opioid therapy for non‐malignant pain have been correlated with a higher risk of infectious diseases such as pneumonia. However clear randomized controlled studies are missing. Furthermore, immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages and T‐cells have been shown to secrete endogenous opioid peptides, which then bind to peripheral opioid receptors to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. In addition to cytokines, hormones and bacterial products, the release of opioid peptides is stimulated by the application of exogenous opioids. In summary, there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and endogenous as well as exogenous opioids. Further to the existing epidemiological studies, controlled clinical studies are needed in the future to elucidate the role of the opioid–immune system interaction in patients and to determine its clinical relevance.', '2018', 192, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=opioids&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 18),

Interventions Concurrent benzodiazepine/opioid use, defined as an overlap of at least one day in the time periods covered by prescriptions for each drug. Main outcome measures Annual percentage of opioid users with concurrent benzodiazepine use; annual incidence of visits to emergency room and inpatient admissions for opioid overdose. Results 9% of opioid users also used a benzodiazepine in 2001, increasing to 17% in 2013 (80% relative increase). This increase was driven mainly by increases among intermittent, as opposed to chronic, opioid users. Compared with opioid users who did not use benzodiazepines, concurrent use of both drugs was associated with an increased risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose (adjusted odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 2.05 to 2.24; P<0.001) among all opioid users. The adjusted odds ratio for an emergency room visit or inpatient admission for opioid overdose was 1.42 (1.33 to 1.51; P<0.001) for intermittent opioid users and 1.81 (1.67 to 1.96; P<0.001) chronic opioid users.

It can be shown that the isobologram is valid only for drugs whose effects are mutually exclusive, whereas the fractional product method is valid only for mutually nonexclusive drugs which have hyperbolic dose-effect curves. Furthermore, in the isobol method, it is laborious to find proper combinations of drugs that would produce an iso-effective curve, and the fractional product method tends to give indication of synergism, since it underestimates the summation of the effect of mutually nonexclusive drugs that have sigmoidal dose-effect curves. The method described herein is devoid of these deficiencies and limitations. The simplified experimental design proposed for multiple drug-effect analysis has the following advantages: It provides a simple diagnostic plot (i.e., the median-effect plot) for evaluating the applicability of the data, and provides parameters that can be directly used to obtain a general equation for the dose-effect relation; the analysis which involves logarithmic conversion and linear regression can be readily carried out with a simple programmable electronic calculator and does not require special graph paper or tables; and the simplicity of the equation allows flexibility of application and the use of a minimum number of data points. This method has been used to analyze experimental data obtained from enzymatic, cellular and animal systems.', '1984', 6263, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=drugs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 18),

We compared a first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a double-blind study.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 1493 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day), perphenazine (8 to 32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per day), or risperidone (1.5 to 6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months. Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day) was included after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The primary aim was to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of these five treatments.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOverall, 74 percent of patients discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1061 of the 1432 patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of those assigned to olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to perphenazine, 82 percent of those assigned to quetiapine, 74 percent of those assigned to risperidone, and 79 percent of those assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P<0.001) or risperidone (P=0.002) group, but not in the perphenazine (P=0.021) or ziprasidone (P=0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P=0.04); olanzapine was associated with more discontinuation for weight gain or metabolic effects, and perphenazine was associated with more discontinuation for extrapyramidal effects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe majority of patients in each group discontinued their assigned treatment owing to inefficacy or intolerable side effects or for other reasons. Olanzapine was the most effective in terms of the rates of discontinuation, and the efficacy of the conventional antipsychotic agent perphenazine appeared similar to that of quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone.

Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations.

Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers — systemic, microenvironmental and cellular — that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall.

Berridge', 'This paper presents a biopsychological theory of drug addiction, the Incentive-Sensitization Theory. The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether wanting drugs (drug craving) is attributable to liking drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute incentive salience to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, wanted, incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive (sensitized) to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary wanting into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience (for wanting) can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug liking) and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.', '1993', 6086, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=drug&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 18),

It is shown that dose and effect are interchangeable via defined parameters. This general equation for the single drug effect has been extended to the multiple drug effect equation for n drugs. These equations provide the theoretical basis for the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation that allows quantitative determination of drug interactions, where CI < 1, = 1, and > 1 indicate synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively. Based on these algorithms, computer software has been developed to allow automated simulation of synergism and antagonism at all dose or effect levels. It displays the dose-effect curve, median-effect plot, combination index plot, isobologram, dose-reduction index plot, and polygonogram for in vitro or in vivo studies.

Working from a simple model of a local labor market, we show that the effects of immigration can be estimated from the correlations between the fraction of immigrants in a city and the employment and wage outcomes of natives. The size of the effects depend on the fraction and skill composition of the immigrants. We go on the compute these correlations using city-specific outcomes for individuals in 120 major SMSAs in the 1970 and 1980 Censuses. We also use the relative industry distributions of immigrants and natives to provide a direct assessment of the degree of labor market competition between them. Our empirical findings indicate a modest degree of competition between immigrants and less-skilled natives. A comparison of industry distributions shows that an increase in the fraction of immigrants in the labor force translates to an approximately equivalent percentage increase in the supply of labor to industries in which less-skilled natives are employed. Based on this calculation, immigrant inflows between 1970 and 1980 generated l-2 percent increases in labor supply to these industries in most cities. A comparison of industry distributions of less-skilled natives in high- and low-immigrant share cities between 1970 and 1980 shows some displacement out of low-wage immigrant-intensive industries. We find little effect of immigration on the employment outcomes of the four race/sex groups that we consider. Our estimates of the effect of immigration on the wages of less-skilled natives are sensitive to the specification and estimation procedure. However, our preferred estimates, which are based on first differences between 1980 and 1970 and the use of instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity of immigrant inflows, imply that an increase in immigrants equal to l percent of an SMSAs population reduces native wages by roughly 1.2 percent.', '2018', 974, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=immigration&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 20),

More specifically, the framework of this discussion is an international project, directed by Ruth Wodak 1 and myself, which examines and compares the way leading politicians in seven EU countries speak and write about immigration and ethnic issues. Although there are obvious contextual differences between immigration, race relations, and hence between talk about these issues in the various countries, the overall theoretical framework for their analysis is essentially the same. This framework, which will only be briefly summarised here, combines elements from the following multidisciplinary triangle: (a) an elite theory of racism as a form of ethnic dominance and inequality, (b) a socio-cognitive approach to (racist, nationalist) ideologies and other social representations, and (c) a complex multi-level analysis of text and talk in context, in general, and of parliamentary debates, in particular. Thus, although file examples analysed in this paper are taken from a debate in the British House of Commons oil asylum seekers, it is assumed that many of the properties of this debate may also be found in immigration debates in other western European countries. Earlier analyses and comparisons of debates on immigration and ethnic issues in Western Europe shows that there are differences of style (e.g., in the UK, France and Germany, MPs may interrupt, heckle and shout, which is much less the case in Spain and the Netherlands), and of nationalist rhetoric (especially in France), but that the main topics, argumentation strategies and especially the standard arguments (topoi) against immigration are very much comparable (Van Dijk, 1993a).', '2019', 92, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=immigration&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 20),

Estimates based on the conventional shift-share instrument are therefore unlikely to identify the short-run causal effect. We propose a \"multiple instrumentation\" procedure that isolates the spatial variation arising from changes in the country-of-origin composition at the national level and permits us to estimate separately the short- and long-run effects.

Wang, Yong Yu', 'As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search.

By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept confidential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous attribute-based encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into users keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a users credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as role-based access control (RBAC).

Nosten', 'Summary Background Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria has arisen in western Cambodia. A concerted international effort is underway to contain artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, but containment strategies are dependent on whether resistance has emerged elsewhere. We aimed to establish whether artemisinin resistance has spread or emerged on the Thailand–Myanmar (Burma) border. Methods In malaria clinics located along the northwestern border of Thailand, we measured six hourly parasite counts in patients with uncomplicated hyperparasitaemic falciparum malaria (≥4% infected red blood cells) who had been given various oral artesunate-containing regimens since 2001. Parasite clearance half-lives were estimated and parasites were genotyped for 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Findings 3202 patients were studied between 2001 and 2010. Parasite clearance half-lives lengthened from a geometric mean of 2·6 h (95% CI 2·5–2·7) in 2001, to 3·7 h (3·6–3·8) in 2010, compared with a mean of 5·5 h (5·2–5·9) in 119 patients in western Cambodia measured between 2007 and 2010. The proportion of slow-clearing infections (half-life ≥6·2 h) increased from 0·6% in 2001, to 20% in 2010, compared with 42% in western Cambodia between 2007 and 2010. Of 1583 infections genotyped, 148 multilocus parasite genotypes were identified, each of which infected between two and 13 patients. The proportion of variation in parasite clearance attributable to parasite genetics increased from 30% between 2001 and 2004, to 66% between 2007 and 2010. Interpretation Genetically determined artemisinin resistance in P falciparum emerged along the Thailand–Myanmar border at least 8 years ago and has since increased substantially. At this rate of increase, resistance will reach rates reported in western Cambodia in 2–6 years.

The end result was a self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increased apprehensions that resulted in the militarization of the border in a way that was disconnected from the actual size of the undocumented flow. Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors show how border militarization affected the behavior of unauthorized migrants and border outcomes to transform undocumented Mexican migration from a circular flow of male workers going to three states into an 11 million person population of settled families living in 50 states.', '2016', 159, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=border&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 20),

The borders of these domains are highly enriched for architectural proteins with characterized roles in insulator function. However, a majority of architectural protein binding sites localize within topological domains, suggesting sites associated with domain borders represent a functionally different subclass of these regulatory elements. How topologically associating domains are established and what differentiates border-associated from non-border architectural protein binding sites remain unanswered questions.ResultsBy mapping the genome-wide target sites for several Drosophila architectural proteins, including previously uncharacterized profiles for TFIIIC and SMC-containing condensin complexes, we uncover an extensive pattern of colocalization in which architectural proteins establish dense clusters at the borders of topological domains. Reporter-based enhancer-blocking insulator activity as well as endogenous domain border strength scale with the occupancy level of architectural protein binding sites, suggesting co-binding by architectural proteins underlies the functional potential of these loci. Analyses in mouse and human stem cells suggest that clustering of architectural proteins is a general feature of genome organization, and conserved architectural protein binding sites may underlie the tissue-invariant nature of topologically associating domains observed in mammals.ConclusionsWe identify a spectrum of architectural protein occupancy that scales with the topological structure of chromosomes and the regulatory potential of these elements. Whereas high occupancy architectural protein binding sites associate with robust partitioning of topologically associating domains and robust insulator function, low occupancy sites appear reserved for gene-specific regulation within topological domains.', '2014', 248, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=border&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 20),

In nontechnical language, Roger Waldinger explains how interconnections between place of origin and destination are built and maintained and why they eventually fall apart.Newcomers moving away from the developing world find that migration is a good thing, letting them enjoy the benefits of residence in the developed world, some of which they send on to their relatives at home in the form of remittances. Residing in a democratic state, free from the long arm of their place of origin, emigrants mobilize to produce change in the homelands they left. Emigration states, in turn, extend their influence across boundaries to protect nationals and retain their loyalty abroad. Time, however, proves corrosive, and in the end most immigrants and their descendants become progressively disconnected from their home country, reorienting their concerns and commitments to the place where they actually live.Although widely studied, cross-border connections remain misunderstood, both by scholars convinced that globalization is leading to a deterritorialized world of unbounded loyalties and flows, and by policy makers trying to turn migration into an engine of development.

Here we quantify the emission sources and health impacts of this haze episode and compare the sources and impacts to an event of similar magnitude occurring under similar meteorological conditions in September–October 2006. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we first calculate the influence of potential fire emissions across the domain on smoke concentrations in three receptor areas downwind—Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore—during the 2006 event. This step maps the sensitivity of each receptor to fire emissions in each grid cell upwind. We then combine these sensitivities with 2006 and 2015 fire emission inventories from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) to estimate the resulting population-weighted smoke exposure. This method, which assumes similar smoke transport pathways in 2006 and 2015, allows near real-time assessment of smoke pollution exposure, and therefore the consequent morbidity and premature mortality, due to severe haze. Our approach also provides rapid assessment of the relative contribution of fire emissions generated in a specific province to smoke-related health impacts in the receptor areas. We estimate that haze in 2015 resulted in 100 300 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than double those of the 2006 event, with much of the increase due to fires in Indonesias South Sumatra Province.

('dinosaurs', 11, 'Recognizing sexual dimorphism in the fossil record: lessons from nonavian dinosaurs', 'Jordan C Mallon', 'Abstract. \n The demonstration of sexual dimorphism in the fossil record can provide vital information about the role that sexual selection has played in the evolution of life. However, statistically robust inferences of sexual dimorphism in fossil organisms are exceedingly difficult to establish, owing to issues of sample size, experimental control, and methodology. This is particularly so in the case of dinosaurs, for which sexual dimorphism has been posited in many species, yet quantifiable data are often lacking. This study presents the first statistical investigation of sexual dimorphism across Dinosauria. It revisits prior analyses that purport to find quantitative evidence for sexual dimorphism in nine dinosaur species. After the available morphological data were subjected to a suite of statistical tests (normality and unimodality tests and mixture modeling), no evidence for sexual dimorphism was found in any of the examined taxa, contrary to conventional wisdom. This is not to say that dinosaurs were not sexually dimorphic (phylogenetic inference suggests they may well have been), only that the available evidence precludes its detection. A priori knowledge of the sexes would greatly facilitate the assessment of sexual dimorphism in the fossil record, and it is suggested that unambiguous indicators of sex (e.g., presence of eggs, embryos, medullary bone) be used to this end.', '2017', 33, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10);

Geller', 'OBJECTIVE\nTo describe the demographic characteristics of women in Illinois who died from cardiovascular disease during pregnancy or up until 1 year postpartum, addressing specific etiologies, timing of death, proportion of potentially preventable mortality, and factors associated with preventability.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a retrospective analysis from the Illinois Department of Public Health Maternal Mortality Review process using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes that attributed cardiovascular disease as the immediate or underlying cause of maternal death in Illinois from 2002 to 2011. We categorized the etiology of cardiovascular mortality, analyzed demographic factors associated with cardiovascular mortality in comparison with noncardiovascular causes, defined the relationship to pregnancy, and identified factors associated with preventability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 636 deaths in Illinois from 2002 to 2011 of pregnant women or within 1 year postpartum. One hundred forty women (22.2%) died of cardiovascular causes, for a cardiovascular mortality rate of 8.2 (95% confidence interval 6.9-9.6) per 100,000 live births. Women with cardiovascular mortality were likely to be older and die postpartum. The most common etiologies were related to acquired cardiovascular disease (97.1%) as compared with congenital heart disease (2.9%). Cardiomyopathy was the most common etiology (n=39 [27.9%]), followed by stroke (n=32 [22.9%]), hypertensive disorders (n=18 [12.9%]), arrhythmias (n=15 [10.7%]), and coronary disease (n=13 [9.3%]). Nearly 75% of cardiac deaths were related to pregnancy as compared with 35.3% of noncardiac deaths. More than one fourth of cardiac deaths (28.1%) were potentially preventable, attributable primarily to health care provider and patient factors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrom 2002 to 2011, more than one fifth of maternal deaths in Illinois were attributed to cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy. More than one fourth of these deaths were potentially preventable. Health care provider and patient factors were identified, which may be modifiable through education and intensive postpartum monitoring, which may diminish mortality. State maternal mortality reviews can identify opportunities for reducing maternal deaths.', '2017', 35, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=illinois&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p < .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses.

Given careless disposal of plastic waste, large amounts of plastic litter accumulate in the environment and disintegrate into microplastics. One of the questions frequently raised in the recent times is if so‐called biodegradable polymers can substitute conventional polymers for several applications and help to tackle this challenge. The answer is not so simple as biodegradability is a certified property occurring only under certain environmental conditions and therefore requires systematic study. As a first step, this study focusses on comparative degradation studies of six polymers (five taken from the so‐called biodegradable polyesters, including poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), poly(3‐hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), Ecoflex, and one well‐known non‐degradable polymer poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) in artificial seawater and freshwater under controlled conditions for 1 year. Only amorphous PLGA shows 100% degradation as determined by weight loss, change in molar mass with time, NMR, electron microscopy, and high‐performance liquid chromatography.

Later in 1980, Kaplan and Aaberg published a series of four similar cases ‘involving a choroidal and retinal pigment epithelium disease not previously described’, which they also called birdshot retinochoroidopathy.3 In 1981, Gass described 11 similar cases and called the disease vitiliginous chorioretinitis.4\n\nIn these first articles on the disease, clinicians had no choice but to rely on fundus examination and fluorescein angiography (FA). Therefore, the striking choroidal involvement seen on fundus examination was at the origin of the eponym the authors chose to give to the disease, because both ‘birdshot’ and ‘vitiliginous’ refer to the typical rice-shaped, depigmented choroidal birdshot fundus lesions (BFLs) that strongly and specifically characterised the condition. Of the two designations, ‘birdshot’ became the universally used and accepted term. It is understandable that such remarkable choroidal signs determined the naming of the disease because the retinal and FA signs were so much less specific and pathognomonic. Nevertheless, an important FA sign was noted by Gass, who observed retinal vasculitis of small and large vessels and the profuse leakage of fluorescein into the retina in the early disease, as well as a reduced presence of fluorescein in the large veins.4 He interpreted this feature as a substantial delay in retinal arteriovenous circulation, an explanation that was later shown to be inexact, thanks to the use of dual FA/indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (see …', '2017', 39, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=called&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Renement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid renements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 1997), with minor dierences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specic renement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious eects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible.

LTL, however, can specify only regular properties, and properties such as correctness of procedures with respect to pre and post conditions, that require matching of calls and returns, are not regular. We introduce a temporal logic of calls and returns (CaRet) for specification and algorithmic verification of correctness requirements of structured programs. The formulas of CaRet are interpreted over sequences of propositional valuations tagged with special symbols call and ret. Besides the standard global temporal modalities, CaRet admits the abstract-next operator that allows a path to jump from a call to the matching return. This operator can be used to specify a variety of non-regular properties such as partial and total correctness of program blocks with respect to pre and post conditions. The abstract versions of the other temporal modalities can be used to specify regular properties of local paths within a procedure that skip over calls to other procedures. CaRet also admits the caller modality that jumps to the most recent pending call, and such caller modalities allow specification of a variety of security properties that involve inspection of the call-stack. Even though verifying context-free properties of pushdown systems is undecidable, we show that model checking CaRet formulas against a pushdown model is decidable. We present a tableau construction that reduces our model checking problem to the emptiness problem for a Buchi pushdown system. The complexity of model checking CaRet formulas is the same as that of checking LTL formulas, namely, polynomial in the model and singly exponential in the size of the specification.', '2004', 3384, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=calls&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

The mechanism considers the static information including permissions, deployment of components, Intent messages passing and API calls for characterizing the Android applications behavior. In order to recognize different intentions of Android malware, different kinds of clustering algorithms can be applied to enhance the malware modeling capability. Besides, we leverage the proposed mechanism and develop a system, called Droid Mat. First, the Droid Mat extracts the information (e.g., requested permissions, Intent messages passing, etc) from each applications manifest file, and regards components (Activity, Service, Receiver) as entry points drilling down for tracing API Calls related to permissions. Next, it applies K-means algorithm that enhances the malware modeling capability. The number of clusters are decided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method on the low rank approximation. Finally, it uses kNN algorithm to classify the application as benign or malicious.

We review the extent, benefits, mechanisms, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of eavesdropping on other species alarm calls. Eavesdropping has been shown experimentally in about 70 vertebrate species, and can entail closely or distantly related species. The benefits of eavesdropping include prompting immediate anti‐predator responses, indirect enhancement of foraging or changed habitat use, and learning about predators. Eavesdropping on heterospecifics can provide more eyes looking for danger, complementary information to that from conspecifics, and potentially information at reduced cost. The response to heterospecific calls can be unlearned or learned. Unlearned responses occur when heterospecific calls have acoustic features similar to that used to recognize conspecific calls, or acoustic properties such as harsh sounds that prompt attention and may allow recognition or facilitate learning. Learning to recognize heterospecific alarm calls is probably essential to allow recognition of the diversity of alarm calls, but the evidence is largely indirect. The value of eavesdropping on different species is affected by problems of signal interception and the relevance of heterospecific alarm calls to the listener. These constraints on eavesdropping will affect how information flows among species and thus affect community function. Some species are ‘keystone’ information producers, while others largely seek information, and these differences probably affect the formation and function of mixed‐species groups. Eavesdroppers might also integrate alarm calls from multiple species to extract relevant and reliable information. Eavesdropping appears to set the stage for the evolution of interspecific deception and communication, and potentially affects communication within species. Overall, we now know that eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls is an important source of information for many species across the globe, and there are ample opportunities for research on mechanisms, fitness consequences and implications for community function and signalling evolution.', '2015', 196, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=calls&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

Aitken, Rob Bishop, D. Rueckert, Zehan Wang', 'Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster than previous CNN-based methods.', '2016', 2422, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=video&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

We demonstrate prediction results by SpeedNet on a wide range of videos containing complex natural motions, and examine the visual cues it utilizes for making those predictions. Importantly, we show that through predicting the speed of videos, the model learns a powerful and meaningful space-time representation that goes beyond simple motion cues.

Analysis of these sequences supports a demographic model in which dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process involving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene flow. In dogs, the domestication bottleneck involved at least a 16-fold reduction in population size, a much more severe bottleneck than estimated previously. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs arose was substantially larger than represented by modern wolf populations. We narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog domestication to an interval spanning 11–16 thousand years ago, predating the rise of agriculture. In light of this finding, we expand upon previous work regarding the increase in copy number of the amylase gene (AMY2B) in dogs, which is believed to have aided digestion of starch in agricultural refuse. We find standing variation for amylase copy number variation in wolves and little or no copy number increase in the Dingo and Husky lineages. In conjunction with the estimated timing of dog origins, these results provide additional support to archaeological finds, suggesting the earliest dogs arose alongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic origin of dogs, we find that, surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages from putative domestication centers is more closely related to dogs, and, instead, the sampled wolves form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in combination with dog-wolf admixture during the process of domestication, suggests that a re-evaluation of past hypotheses regarding dog origins is necessary.', '2014', 449, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dogs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

Through an examination of theoretical, experimental, and molecular dynamics simulation studies of evaporation, this review will show that the HK relation is incomplete, since it is missing an important physical concept: the coupling between the vapor and liquid phases during evaporation. The review also examines a modified HK relation, obtained from the quantum-mechanically based statistical rate theory (SRT) expression for the evaporation flux and applying a limit to it in which the thermal energy is dominant. Explicit expressions for the evaporation and condensation coefficients are defined in this limit, with the surprising result that the coefficients are not bounded by unity. An examination is made with 127 reported evaporation experiments of water and of ethanol, leading to a new physical interpretation of the coefficients.

Nevertheless, even in the case of $4$-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime --- which is known to be stable --- manifest positivity of the canonical energy is difficult to establish, due to the presence of constraints on the initial data as well as the gauge dependence of the canonical energy integrand. Consideration of perturbations generated by a Hertz potential would appear to be a promising way to improve this situation, since the constraints and gauge dependence are eliminated when the canonical energy is expressed in terms of the Hertz potential. We prove that the canonical energy of a metric perturbation of Schwarzschild that is generated by a Hertz potential is positive. We relate the energy quantity arising in the linear stability proof of Dafermos, Holzegel and Rodnianski (DHR) to the canonical energy of an associated metric perturbation generated by a Hertz potential. We also relate the Regge-Wheeler variable of DHR to the ordinary Regge-Wheeler and twist potential variables of the associated perturbation. Since the Hertz potential formalism can be generalized to a Kerr black hole, our results may be useful for the analysis of the linear stability of Kerr.', '2018', 8, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=hertz&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9);

Amaro-Seoane', 'The formation of compact stellar-mass binaries is a difficult, but interesting problem in astrophysics. There are two main formation channels: In the field via binary star evolution, or in dense stellar systems via dynamical interactions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected black hole binaries (BHBs) via their gravitational radiation. These detections provide us with information about the physical parameters of the system. It has been claimed that when the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is operating, the joint observation of these binaries with LIGO will allow us to derive the channels that lead to their formation. However, we show that for BHBs in dense stellar systems dynamical interactions could lead to high eccentricities such that a fraction of the relativistic mergers are not audible to LISA. A non-detection by LISA puts a lower limit of about $0.005$ on the eccentricity of a BHB entering the LIGO band. On the other hand, a deci-Hertz observatory, like DECIGO or Tian Qin, would significantly enhance the chances of a joint detection, and shed light on the formation channels of these binaries.', '2017', 44, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=hertz&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

This property is of great interest for the applications but delicate to characterize, especially for narrow linewidth lasers.

For each measurement, two lasers act as references to characterize a third one. Phase noise power spectral density from 0.5 Hz to 0.8 MHz Fourier frequencies can be derived for each laser by a mere change in the configuration of the lasers.

For almost two decades, 45 tesla has been the highest achievable direct-current (d.c.) magnetic field; however, such a field requires the use of a 31-megawatt, 33.6-tesla resistive magnet inside 11.4-tesla low-temperature superconductor coils1, and such high-power resistive magnets are available in only a few facilities worldwide2. By contrast, superconducting magnets are widespread owing to their low power requirements. Here we report a high-temperature superconductor coil that generates a magnetic field of 14.4 tesla inside a 31.1-tesla resistive background magnet to obtain a d.c. magnetic field of 45.5 tesla—the highest field achieved so far, to our knowledge. The magnet uses a conductor tape coated with REBCO (REBa2Cu3Ox, where RE = Y, Gd) on a 30-micrometre-thick substrate3, making the coil highly compact and capable of operating at the very high winding current density of 1,260 amperes per square millimetre. Operation at such a current density is possible only because the magnet is wound without insulation4, which allows rapid and safe quenching from the superconducting to the normal state5–10. The 45.5-tesla test magnet validates predictions11 for high-field copper oxide superconductor magnets by achieving a field twice as high as those generated by low-temperature superconducting magnets.A copper oxide high-temperature superconductor magnet generates a direct-current magnetic field of 45.5 tesla—the highest value reported so far—using a design that enables operation at high current densities.', '2019', 149, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=tesla&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

Tesla turbine offers an attractive option for the expander if an efficient design can be well achieved. Faced the theoretical and computational challenges associated with the feasibility of Tesla turbine in a small-scale waste heat recovery system, this paper formulates a systematic design methodology to seek optimal parameters and geometric model of the Tesla turbine which is applied to a coolant waste heat recovery system of an automobile engine. To achieve this goal, a detailed investigation into the performance of Tesla turbine, which incorporates experimental and computational fluid dynamics analysis manifests that Tesla turbine achieves higher performance at lower rotation-speed. Performance analysis on the waste heat recovery system under various operating conditions is conducted based on a comprehensive thermodynamic model. Results show that the total power and overall thermal efficiency of the waste heat recovery system are clearly increased over a low rotation-speed range, furtherly, which can be improved by selecting appropriate viscosity of the working fluid and number of nozzles.

Under high-pressure turbulent hydrogen flow, severe aerodynamic noise may be caused and large energy loss inside Tesla valves may be generated, which can cause uncomfortable noise in vehicles. In this paper, the valve stage number and the pressure ratio between the inlet and the outlet are analyzed to investigate the possibility of the occurrence of aerodynamic noise and energy loss inside Tesla valves, and Mach number, turbulent dissipation rate, and exergy loss are used and evaluated as the criterion. The results show that both Mach number and exergy loss increase with the increasing of pressure ratio, but with the decrease of valve stage number, Mach number increases and exergy loss decreases. In addition, large turbulent dissipation rate at each valve stage appears near the bifurcation and the confluence between the straight channel and the bend channel of multi-stage Tesla valves. The correlation between the valve stage number, the pressure ratio, and the maximum Mach number is fitted, which can be used to estimate the possibility of the occurrence of aerodynamic noise.', '2019', 24, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=tesla&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

For a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle, the hydrogen is reserved in a high pressure level to promote the recharge mileage while relatively low-pressure hydrogen is demanded for proper functioning of the fuel cell stack, so that decompression of hydrogen is needed before hydrogen flowing into the fuel cell. With a reverse flow through Tesla valves, there appears a large pressure drop between the inlet and outlet, which can be used for hydrogen decompression nicely. However, a single-stage Tesla valve cannot meet the pressure drop requirement, so multi-stage Tesla valves are utilized. In this paper, numerical simulations of reversed hydrogen flow through multi-stage Tesla valves are carried out. The stage number of multi-stage Tesla valves and the inlet/outlet pressure ratio are both studied, and the distributions of temperature, pressure, and velocity inside multi-stage Tesla valves are all investigated. Results show that as the stage number increases or the inlet/outlet pressure ratio decreases, the pressure and the velocity inside multi-stage Tesla valves decrease, and the less the stage number, the more possibility for the velocity higher than local acoustic speed. Besides, a power-law relationship between the flow rate, the stage number and pressure ratio is summarized.', '2019', 22, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=tesla&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

Abud', 'PURPOSE: To compare the time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced- magnetic resonance angiography techniques in a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance unit with digital subtraction angiography with the latest flat-panel technology and 3D reconstruction in the evaluation of embolized cerebral aneurysms. INTRODUCTION: Many embolized aneurysms are subject to a recurrence of intra-aneurismal filling. Traditionally, imaging surveillance of coiled aneurysms has consisted of repeated digital subtraction angiography. However, this method has a small but significant risk of neurological complications, and many authors have advocated the use of noninvasive imaging methods for the surveillance of embolized aneurysms. METHODS: Forty-three aneurysms in 30 patients were studied consecutively between November 2009 and May 2010. Two interventional neuroradiologists rated the time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography, the contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography, and finally the digital subtraction angiography, first independently and then in consensus. The status of aneurysm occlusion was assessed according to the Raymond scale, which indicates the level of recanalization according to degrees: Class 1: excluded aneurysm; Class 2: persistence of a residual neck; Class 3: persistence of a residual aneurysm. The agreement among the analyses was assessed by applying the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was excellent for both methods (K  =  0.93; 95 % CI: 0.84-1). Inter-technical agreement was almost perfect between time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography (K = 0.98; 95 % CI: 0.93-1) and between time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography and contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography (K = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.93-1). Disagreement occurred in only one case (2.3%), which was classified as Class I by time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography and Class II by digital subtraction angiography. The agreement between contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography was perfect (K  =  1; 95% CI: 1-1). In three patients, in-stent stenosis was identified by magnetic resonance angiography but not confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. CONCLUSION: Digital subtraction angiography and both 3T magnetic resonance angiography techniques have excellent reproducibility for the assessment of aneurysms embolized exclusively with coils. In those cases also treated with stent remodeling, digital subtraction angiography may still be necessary to confirm eventual parent artery stenosis, as identified by magnetic resonance angiography.', '2011', 24, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teslas&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

Here we report the observation of an extremely large positive magnetoresistance at low temperatures in the non-magnetic layered transition-metal dichalcogenide WTe2: 452,700 per cent at 4.5 kelvins in a magnetic field of 14.7 teslas, and 13 million per cent at 0.53 kelvins in a magnetic field of 60 teslas. In contrast with other materials, there is no saturation of the magnetoresistance value even at very high applied fields. Determination of the origin and consequences of this effect, and the fabrication of thin films, nanostructures and devices based on the extremely large positive magnetoresistance of WTe2, will represent a significant new direction in the study of magnetoresistivity.', '2014', 635, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teslas&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

The availability of charging infrastructure reduces on-board energy storage requirements and costs. On-board charger systems can be conductive or inductive. An off-board charger can be designed for high charging rates and is less constrained by size and weight. Level 1 (convenience), Level 2 (primary), and Level 3 (fast) power levels are discussed.

False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people.

We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information.

In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28].

Users of online social media share information, connect with other people and stay informed about trending events. However, much recent information appearing on social media is dubious and, in some cases, intended to mislead. Such content is often called fake news. Large amounts of online fake news has the potential to cause serious problems in society. Many point to the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign as having been influenced by fake news. Subsequent to this election, the term has entered the mainstream vernacular. Moreover it has drawn the attention of industry and academia, seeking to understand its origins, distribution and effects. Of critical interest is the ability to detect when online content is untrue and intended to mislead. This is technically challenging for several reasons. Using social media tools, content is easily generated and quickly spread, leading to a large volume of content to analyse. Online information is very diverse, covering a large number of subjects, which contributes complexity to this task. The truth and intent of any statement often cannot be assessed by computers alone, so efforts must depend on collaboration between humans and technology. For instance, some content that is deemed by experts of being false and intended to mislead are available. While these sources are in limited supply, they can form a basis for such a shared effort. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the finding to date relating to fake news. We characterize the negative impact of online fake news, and the state-of-the-art in detection methods. Many of these rely on identifying features of the users, content, and context that indicate misinformation. We also study existing datasets that have been used for classifying fake news.

What is the secret of their success? Two leading Japanese business experts, Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi, are the first to tie the success of Japanese companies to their ability to create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products and technologies. In The Knowledge-Creating Company, Nonaka and Takeuchi provide an inside look at how Japanese companies go about creating this new knowledge organizationally. The authors point out that there are two types of knowledge: explicit knowledge, contained in manuals and procedures, and tacit knowledge, learned only by experience, and communicated only indirectly, through metaphor and analogy. U.S. managers focus on explicit knowledge. The Japanese, on the other hand, focus on tacit knowledge. And this, the authors argue, is the key to their success--the Japanese have learned how to transform tacit into explicit knowledge. To explain how this is done--and illuminate Japanese business practices as they do so--the authors range from Greek philosophy to Zen Buddhism, from classical economists to modern management gurus, illustrating the theory of organizational knowledge creation with case studies drawn from such firms as Honda, Canon, Matsushita, NEC, Nissan, 3M, GE, and even the U.S. Marines. For instance, using Matsushitas development of the Home Bakery (the worlds first fully automated bread-baking machine for home use), they show how tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit knowledge: when the designers couldnt perfect the dough kneading mechanism, a software programmer apprenticed herself withthe master baker at Osaka International Hotel, gained a tacit understanding of kneading, and then conveyed this information to the engineers. In addition, the authors show that, to create knowledge, the best management style is neither top-down nor bottom-up, but rather what they call \"middle-up-down,\" in which the middle managers form a bridge between the ideals of top management and the chaotic realities of the frontline. As we make the turn into the 21st century, a new society is emerging. Peter Drucker calls it the \"knowledge society,\" one that is drastically different from the \"industrial society,\" and one in which acquiring and applying knowledge will become key competitive factors. Nonaka and Takeuchi go a step further, arguing that creating knowledge will become the key to sustaining a competitive advantage in the future. Because the competitive environment and customer preferences changes constantly, knowledge perishes quickly.

Examining case studies drawn from such firms as Honda, Canon, Matsushita, NEC, 3M, GE, and the U.S. Marines, this book reveals how Japanese companies translate tacit to explicit knowledge and use it to produce new processes, products, and services.', '1995', 8560, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=company&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

Takeuchi', 'Japanese companies have become successful because of their skill and expertise at creating organizational knowledge. Organizational knowledge is not only the creation of new knowledge, but also disseminating it throughout the organization, and embodying it in products, services, and systems. Knowledge is the new competitive resource, and its creation and utilization is a dynamic, interactive process. Knowledge is used as the basic unit of analysis to explain firm behavior; a business creates and processes knowledge. Knowledge may be explicit or tacit; this study treats them as complements that form a dynamic relationship. The individual interacts with the organization through knowledge; knowledge creation occurs at the individual, group, and organizational levels. The forms of knowledge interaction (between tacit and explicit, and between individual and firm) produce four major processes of knowledge conversion: from tacit to explicit, explicit to explicit, explicit to tacit, and tacit to tacit. Japanese companies create new knowledge by converting tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge. The book has three goals: to formalize a generic model of organizational knowledge creation, explain why certain Japanese companies have been continuously successful in innovation, and develop a universal model of company management based on convergence of knowledge practices in Japan and the world. First presents a philosophical exposition of knowledge and its application to managemen, then the core concepts of knowledge creation, with four modes of knowledge conversion. The Matsushita company is used to illustrate the process model of organization knowledge creation. The two traditional styles of management (top-down and bottom-up) are shown not to be effective in fostering the dynamic necessary to create organizational knowledge, and a new organization structure considered most conducive to knowledge creation is proposed.

Front-end technologies consider four dimensions: Smart Manufacturing, Smart Products, Smart Supply Chain and Smart Working, while base technologies consider four elements: internet of things, cloud services, big data and analytics. We performed a survey in 92 manufacturing companies to study the implementation of these technologies. Our findings show that Industry 4.0 is related to a systemic adoption of the front-end technologies, in which Smart Manufacturing plays a central role. Our results also show that the implementation of the base technologies is challenging companies, since big data and analytics are still low implemented in the sample studied.

The business model unlocks latent value from a technology, but its logic constrains the subsequent search for new, alternative models for other technologies later on--an implicit cognitive dimension overlooked in most discourse on the topic. We explore the intellectual roots of the concept, offer a working definition and show how the Xerox Corporation arose by employing an effective business model to commercialize a technology rejected by other leading companies of the day. We then show the long shadow that this model cast upon Xeroxs later management of selected spin-off companies from Xerox PARC. Xerox evaluated the technical potential of these spin-offs through its own business model, while those spin-offs that became successful did so through evolving business models that came to differ substantially from that of Xerox.

With continuous improvement of lithium ion batteries in energy density, enhancing their safety is becoming increasingly urgent for the electric vehicle development. Thermal runaway is the key scientific problem in battery safety research. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review on the thermal runaway mechanism of the commercial lithium ion battery for electric vehicles. Learning from typical accidents, the abuse conditions that may lead to thermal runaway have been summarized. The abuse conditions include mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, and thermal abuse. Internal short circuit is the most common feature for all the abuse conditions. The thermal runaway follows a mechanism of chain reactions, during which the decomposition reaction of the battery component materials occurs one after another. A novel energy release diagram, which can quantify the reaction kinetics for all the battery component materials, is proposed to interpret the mechanisms of the chain reactions during thermal runaway. The relationship between the internal short circuit and the thermal runaway is further clarified using the energy release diagram with two cases. Finally, a three-level protection concept is proposed to help reduce the thermal runaway hazard. The three-level protection can be fulfilled by providing passive defense and early warning before the occurrence of thermal runaway, by enhancing the intrinsic thermal stability of the materials, and by reducing the secondary hazard like thermal runaway propagation.', '2018', 734, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=electric&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 9),

Stiglitz, Andrew M Weiss', 'According to basic economics, if demand exceeds supply, prices will rise, thus decreasing demand or increasing supply until demand and supply are in equilibrium; thus if prices do their job, rationing will not exist. However, credit rationing does exist. This paper demonstrates that even in equilibrium, credit rationing will exist in a loan market. Credit rationing is defined as occurring either (a) among loan applicants who appear identical, and some do and do not receive loans, even though the rejected applicants would pay higher interest rates; or (b) there are groups who, with a given credit supply, cannot obtain loans at any rate, even though with larger credit supply they would. A model is developed to provide the first theoretical justification for true credit rationing. The amount of the loan and the amount of collateral demanded affect the behavior and distribution of borrowers. Consequently, faced with increased credit demand, it may not be profitable to raise interest rates or collateral; instead banks deny loans to borrowers who are observationally indistinguishable from those receiving loans. It is not argued that credit rationing always occurs, but that it occurs under plausible assumptions about lender and borrower behavior. In the model, interest rates serve as screening devices for evaluating risk. Interest rates change the behavior (serve as incentive mechanism) for the borrower, increasing the relative attractiveness of riskier projects; banks ration credit, rather than increase rates when there is excess demand. Banks are shown not to increase collateral as a means of allocating credit; although collateral may have incentivizing effects, it may have adverse selection effects. Equity, nonlinear payment schedules, and contingency contracts may be introduced and yet there still may be rationing. The law of supply and demand is thus a result generated by specific assumptions and is model specific; credit rationing does exist.

Schumpeter', 'Schumpeter first reviews the basic economic concepts that describe the recurring economic processes of a commercially organized state in which private property, division of labor, and free competition prevail. These constitute what Schumpeter calls \"the circular flow of economic life,\" such as consumption, factors and means of production, labor, value, prices, cost, exchange, money as a circulating medium, and exchange value of money. The principal focus of the book is advancing the idea that change (economic development) is the key to explaining the features of a modern economy. Schumpeter emphasizes that his work deals with economic dynamics or economic development, not with theories of equilibrium or \"circular flow\" of a static economy, which have formed the basis of traditional economics. Interest, profit, productive interest, and business fluctuations, capital, credit, and entrepreneurs can better be explained by reference to processes of development. A static economy would know no productive interest, which has its source in the profits that arise from the process of development (successful execution of new combinations). The principal changes in a dynamic economy are due to technical innovations in the production process. Schumpeter elaborates on the role of credit in economic development; credit expansion affects the distribution of income and capital formation. Bank credit detaches productive resources from their place in circular flow to new productive combinations and innovations. Capitalism inherently depends upon economic progress, development, innovation, and expansive activity, which would be suppressed by inflexible monetary policy. The essence of development consists in the introduction of innovations into the system of production. This period of incorporation or adsorption is a period of readjustment, which is the essence of depression. Both profits of booms and losses from depression are part of the process of development. There is a distinction between the processes of creating a new productive apparatus and the process of merely operating it once it is created. Development is effected by the entrepreneur, who guides the diversion of the factors of production into new combinations for better use; by recasting the productive process, including the introduction of new machinery, and producing products at less expense, the entrepreneur creates a surplus, which he claims as profit. The entrepreneur requires capital, which is found in the money market, and for which the entrepreneur pays interest. The entrepreneur creates a model for others to follow, and the appearance of numerous new entrepreneurs causes depressions as the system struggles to achieve a new equilibrium. The entrepreneurial profit then vanishes in the vortex of competition; the stage is set for new combinations. Risk is not part of the entrepreneurial function; risk falls on the provider of capital.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN.

Liu, Xiaolin Lin, Cheng-Ying Huang', 'Background Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, lipid peroxide-mediated cell death that may be exploited to selective elimination of damaged and malignant cells. Recent studies have identified that small-molecule erastin specifically inhibits transmembrane cystine–glutamate antiporter system x c − , prevents extracellular cystine import and ultimately causes ferroptosis in certain cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying erastin-induced ferroptosis resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Methods We treated ovarian cancer cells with erastin and examined cell viability, cellular ROS and metabolites of the transsulfuration pathway. We also depleted cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and NRF2 to investigate the CBS and NRF2 dependency in erastin-resistant cells. Results We found that prolonged erastin treatment induced ferroptosis resistance. Upon exposure to erastin, cells gradually adapted to cystine deprivation via sustained activation of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, allowing the cells to bypass erastin insult. CBS, the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, was constantly upregulated and was critical for the resistance. Knockdown of CBS by RNAi in erastin-resistant cells caused ferroptotic cell death, while CBS overexpression conferred ferroptosis resistance. We determined that the antioxidant transcriptional factor, NRF2 was constitutively activated in erastin-resistant cells and NRF2 transcriptionally upregulated CBS. Genetically repression of NRF2 enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Conclusions Based on these results, we concluded that constitutive activation of NRF2/CBS signalling confers erastin-induced ferroptosis resistance. This study demonstrates a new mechanism underlying ferroptosis resistance, and has implications for the therapeutic response to erastin-induced ferroptosis.', '2019', 41, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=cbs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

Here we tested the hypothesis that the suppression of mitochondrial electron transport in DS cells is due to high expression of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and subsequent overproduction of the gaseous transmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Fibroblasts from DS individuals showed higher CBS expression than control cells; CBS localization was both cytosolic and mitochondrial. DS cells produced significantly more H2S and polysulfide and exhibited a profound suppression of mitochondrial electron transport, oxygen consumption, and ATP generation. DS cells also exhibited slower proliferation rates. In DS cells, pharmacological inhibition of CBS activity with aminooxyacetate or siRNA-mediated silencing of CBS normalized cellular H2S levels, restored Complex IV activity, improved mitochondrial electron transport and ATP synthesis, and restored cell proliferation. Thus, CBS-derived H2S is responsible for the suppression of mitochondrial function in DS cells. When H2S overproduction is corrected, the tonic suppression of Complex IV is lifted, and mitochondrial electron transport is restored.

The Dp(17Abcg1-Cbs)1Yah DS mouse model (Dp1Yah) shows cognitive phenotypes that need to be investigated to identify the main genetic driver. Here, we report that three copies of the cystathionine-beta-synthase gene (Cbs) in the Dp1Yah mice are necessary to observe a deficit in the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm. Moreover, the overexpression of Cbs alone is sufficient to induce deficits in the NOR test. Accordingly, overexpressing human CBS specifically in Camk2a-expressing neurons leads to impaired objects discrimination. Altogether, this shows that Cbs overdosage is involved in DS learning and memory phenotypes. To go further, we identified compounds that interfere with the phenotypical consequence of CBS overdosage in yeast. Pharmacological intervention in Tg(CBS) mice with one selected compound restored memory in the NOR test.

Further analysis using proteomic approaches highlighted several molecular pathways, including synaptic transmission, cell projection morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton, that are affected by DYRK1A and CBS overexpression.

In this article, we present CBS-tandem mass spectrometry (CBS-MS/MS) as a novel tool for the rapid and simultaneous determination of four commonly used immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) in whole blood: tacrolimus (TAC) and cyclosporine-A (CycA), which are calcineurin inhibitors; and sirolimus (SIR) and everolimus (EVR), which are both mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors. Given that CBS extracts via free concentration, analytes that are largely bound to plasma proteins or red blood cells provide considerably lower extraction recovery rates. Therefore, we defy the solventless philosophy of SPME-based techniques, like CBS, by performing the analyte-enrichment step via direct immersion in a solvent-modified matrix. The assay was linear within the evaluated range of concentrations (between 1 and 100 ng/mL for EVR/SIR/TAC and 10-1000 ng/mL for CycA), and the limits of quantification were determined to be 10 ng/mL for CycA and 1 ng/mL for EVR/SIR/TAC. Good accuracy (87-119%) and linearity (r2 ≥ 0.99) were attained over the evaluated range for all ISDs. Interassay imprecision (CV) determined from incurred sample reanalysis was ≤10% for all ISDs. Our method was validated using Liquichek™ whole blood immunosuppressant quality control (QC) standards purchased from Bio-Rad. Concentrations determined by CBS-MS/MS were inside the range specified by Bio-Rad and within 15% of the expected mean value for all ISDs at all QC levels.

No statistical differences (RSD ≤ 7%) in the calibration curve slopes of ISDs in blood were observed. CBS offers a simpler workflow than that of traditional methods; it eliminates the need for chromatographic separation and provides a clean extract that allows for long-term MS instrumental operation with minimal maintenance.

To obtain complete sequences of the MAL loci of this strain, a near-complete genome assembly was generated using the Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION sequencing platform. Except for CHRXII, all sixteen chromosomes were assembled as single contigs. Four loci harboring putative maltose transporter genes (SeMALT1-4), located in subtelomeric regions of CHRII, CHRV, CHRXIII, and CHRXVI, were completely resolved. The near-identical loci on CHRV and CHRXVI strongly resembled canonical S. cerevisiae MAL loci, while those on CHRII and CHRXIII showed different structures suggestive of gene loss. Overexpression of SeMALT1-4 in a maltose-transport-deficient S. cerevisiae strain restored growth on maltose, but not on maltotriose, indicating maltose-specific transport functionality of all four transporters. Simultaneous CRISPR-Cas9-assisted deletion of only SeMALT2 and SeMALT4, which shared 99.7% sequence identity, eliminated growth of S. eubayanus CBS 12357T on maltose. Transcriptome analysis of S. eubayanus CBS 12357T established that SeMALT1 and SeMALT3, are poorly expressed in maltose-grown cultures, while SeMALT2 and SeMALT4 were expressed at much higher levels than SeMALT1 and SeMALT3, indicating that only SeMALT2/4 are responsible for maltose consumption in CBS 12357T.

The 8-node hexahedral element (H8) is used for three-dimensional flows. Two types of CS-FEM are implemented in this paper. One is standard CS-FEM with quadrilateral gradient smoothing cells for Q4 element and hexahedron cells for H8 element. Another is called as n-sided CS-FEM (nCS-FEM) whose gradient smoothing cells are triangles for Q4 element and pyramids for H8 element.

The benchmarks show that CBS/CS-FEM and CBS/nCS-FEM are capable to solve incompressible laminar flow, and can produce reliable results for both steady and unsteady flows. The proposed CBS/CS-FEM method has merits on better robustness against distorted mesh with only slight more computation time and without losing accuracy, which is important for problems with heavy mesh distortion.

To test this mechanism, we employed cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote knockout mice, fed with a methionine rich diet (CBS+/− +Met), supplemented with H2S-donor NaHS for 8 weeks. Treatment with NaHS, normalizes plasma H2S, and completely prevents trabecular bone loss in CBS+/− mice. Our data showed that HHcy caused inhibition of HDAC3 activity and subsequent inflammation by imbalancing redox homeostasis.

A blockade of HDAC3 inhibition in CBS+/− mice by HDAC activator ITSA-1, led to the remodeling of histone landscapes in the genome and thereby attenuated histone acetylation-dependent inflammatory signaling.

In the present study, we found a decline of plasma and striatal sulfide level in 1-methy-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced PD mouse model. Interestingly, among the three H2S generating enzymes, only cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) expression was largely reduced in the striatum of MPTP-treated mice.

Striatal CBS overexpression, elicited by stereotaxic delivery with Cbs gene using recombinant adeno-associated-virus (rAAV-Cbs), successfully enhanced the sulfide level in the striatum and partially rescued the MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the midbrain. Specifically, striatal CBS overexpression alleviated the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron losses in the nigro-striatal pathway, with a concomitant inhibition of glial activation in MPTP-treated mice.

Here, a brief overview of the system and some aspects of its performance, including quality assessment diagnostics from innovation and residual statistics, is given.By comparing MERRA with other updated reanalyses [the interim version of the next ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)], advances made in this new generation of reanalyses, as well as remaining deficiencies, are identified.

Following twin astronauts, one of which spent a year-long mission on the International Space Station, Garrett-Bakelman et al. examined molecular and physiological traits that may be affected by time in space (see the Perspective by Löbrich and Jeggo). Sequencing the components of whole blood revealed that the length of telomeres, which is important to maintain in dividing cells and may be related to human aging, changed substantially during space flight and again upon return to Earth. Coupled with changes in DNA methylation in immune cells and cardiovascular and cognitive effects, this study provides a basis to assess the hazards of long-term space habitation. Science, this issue p. eaau8650; see also p. 127 An integrated analysis reveals the changes, down to the molecular level, in one man during a year-long spaceflight. INTRODUCTION To date, 559 humans have been flown into space, but long-duration (>300 days) missions are rare (n = 8 total). Long-duration missions that will take humans to Mars and beyond are planned by public and private entities for the 2020s and 2030s; therefore, comprehensive studies are needed now to assess the impact of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, brain, and overall physiology. The space environment is made harsh and challenging by multiple factors, including confinement, isolation, and exposure to environmental stressors such as microgravity, radiation, and noise. The selection of one of a pair of monozygotic (identical) twin astronauts for NASA’s first 1-year mission enabled us to compare the impact of the spaceflight environment on one twin to the simultaneous impact of the Earth environment on a genetically matched subject. RATIONALE The known impacts of the spaceflight environment on human health and performance, physiology, and cellular and molecular processes are numerous and include bone density loss, effects on cognitive performance, microbial shifts, and alterations in gene regulation. However, previous studies collected very limited data, did not integrate simultaneous effects on multiple systems and data types in the same subject, or were restricted to 6-month missions. Measurement of the same variables in an astronaut on a year-long mission and in his Earth-bound twin indicated the biological measures that might be used to determine the effects of spaceflight. Presented here is an integrated longitudinal, multidimensional description of the effects of a 340-day mission onboard the International Space Station. RESULTS Physiological, telomeric, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomic, immune, microbiomic, cardiovascular, vision-related, and cognitive data were collected over 25 months. Some biological functions were not significantly affected by spaceflight, including the immune response (T cell receptor repertoire) to the first test of a vaccination in flight. However, significant changes in multiple data types were observed in association with the spaceflight period; the majority of these eventually returned to a preflight state within the time period of the study. These included changes in telomere length, gene regulation measured in both epigenetic and transcriptional data, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, subfoveal choroidal thickness and peripapillary total retinal thickness, and serum metabolites. In addition, some factors were significantly affected by the stress of returning to Earth, including inflammation cytokines and immune response gene networks, as well as cognitive performance. For a few measures, persistent changes were observed even after 6 months on Earth, including some genes’ expression levels, increased DNA damage from chromosomal inversions, increased numbers of short telomeres, and attenuated cognitive function. CONCLUSION Given that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight. The persistence of the molecular changes (e.g., gene expression) and the extrapolation of the identified risk factors for longer missions (>1 year) remain estimates and should be demonstrated with these measures in future astronauts. Finally, changes described in this study highlight pathways and mechanisms that may be vulnerable to spaceflight and may require safeguards for longer space missions; thus, they serve as a guide for targeted countermeasures or monitoring during future missions. Multidimensional, longitudinal assays of the NASA Twins Study. (Left and middle) Genetically identical twin subjects (ground and flight) were characterized across 10 generalized biomedical modalities before (preflight), during (inflight), and after flight (postflight) for a total of 25 months (circles indicate time points at which data were collected). (Right) Data were integrated to guide biomedical metrics across various “-omes” for future missions (concentric circles indicate, from inner to outer, cytokines, proteome, transcriptome, and methylome). To understand the health impact of long-duration spaceflight, one identical twin astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the International Space Station; his twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments identified spaceflight-specific changes, including decreased body mass, telomere elongation, genome instability, carotid artery distension and increased intima-media thickness, altered ocular structure, transcriptional and metabolic changes, DNA methylation changes in immune and oxidative stress–related pathways, gastrointestinal microbiota alterations, and some cognitive decline postflight. Although average telomere length, global gene expression, and microbiome changes returned to near preflight levels within 6 months after return to Earth, increased numbers of short telomeres were observed and expression of some genes was still disrupted. These multiomic, molecular, physiological, and behavioral datasets provide a valuable roadmap of the putative health risks for future human spaceflight.', '2019', 280, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nasa&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

The aim of this group is to assemble the scientific framework that will guide the exploration of ocean worlds, and to identify and prioritize science objectives for ocean worlds over the next several decades. The overarching goal of an Ocean Worlds exploration program as defined by ROW is to “identify ocean worlds, characterize their oceans, evaluate their habitability, search for life, and ultimately understand any life we find.” The ROW team supports the creation of an exploration program that studies the full spectrum of ocean worlds, that is, not just the exploration of known ocean worlds such as Europa but candidate ocean worlds such as Triton as well. The ROW team finds that the confirmed ocean worlds Enceladus, Titan, and Europa are the highest priority bodies to target in the near term to address ROW goals. Triton is the highest priority candidate ocean world to target in the near term. A major finding of this study is that, to map out a coherent Ocean Worlds Program, significant input is required from studies here on Earth; rigorous Research and Analysis studies are called for to enable some future ocean worlds missions to be thoughtfully planned and undertaken. A second finding is that progress needs to be made in the area of collaborations between Earth ocean scientists and extraterrestrial ocean scientists.', '2019', 85, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nasa&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

It has been years since NASA has had a vigorous, broad-based program in advanced space technology development, and NASAs technology base is largely depleted. As noted in a recent National Research Council report on the U.S. civil space program: Future U.S. leadership in space requires a foundation of sustained technology advances that can enable the development of more capable, reliable, and lower-cost spacecraft and launch vehicles to achieve space program goals. A strong advanced technology development foundation is needed also to enhance technology readiness of new missions, mitigate their technological risks, improve the quality of cost estimates, and thereby contribute to better overall mission cost management. Yet financial support for this technology base has eroded over the years. The United States is now living on the innovation funded in the past and has an obligation to replenish this foundational element. NASA has developed a draft set of technology roadmaps to guide the development of space technologies under the leadership of the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist. The NRC appointed the Steering Committee for NASA Technology Roadmaps and six panels to evaluate the draft roadmaps, recommend improvements, and prioritize the technologies within each and among all of the technology areas as NASA finalizes the roadmaps.

As a result of these community efforts, and to NASA s credit, NASA s MMOD programs and models are now widely used and respected by the providers and users of both government and commercial satellites, nationally as well as internationally. Satellites have been redesigned to protect critical components from MMOD damage by moving critical components from exterior surfaces to deep inside a satellite s structure. Orbits are monitored and altered to minimize the risk of collision with tracked orbital debris. MMOD shielding added to the International Space Station (ISS) protects critical components and astronauts from potentially catastrophic damage that might result from smaller, untracked debris and meteoroid impacts. The space shuttle, as it orbited Earth, and whether docked to the ISS or not, was optimally oriented to protect its fragile thermal protection and thermal radiation systems from MMOD damage. In addition, astronauts inspected its thermal protection system for MMOD damage before the shuttle reentered Earth s atmosphere; Orion, NASA s capsule to carry astronauts to low Earth orbit, includes designs to mitigate the threat of MMOD damage and provide increased safety to the crew. When a handful of reasonable assumptions are used in NASA s MMOD models, scenarios are uncovered that conclude that the current orbital debris environment has already reached a \"tipping point.\" That is, the amount of debris - in terms of the population of large debris objects, as well as overall mass of debris in orbit - currently in orbit has reached a threshold where it will continually collide with itself, further increasing the population of orbital debris. This increase will lead to corresponding increases in spacecraft failures, which will only create more feedback into the system, increasing the debris population growth rate. The increase thus far has been most rapid in low Earth orbit (LEO), with geosynchronous Earth orbits (GEOs) potentially suffering the same fate, but over a much longer time period. The exact timing and pace of this exponential growth are uncertain, but the serious implications of such a scenario require careful attention because of the strategic importance of U.S. space operations. The Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget contracted with the National Research Council for a study to perform three tasks: review NASA s MMOD programs and efforts, recommend in which of those NASA should increase or decrease its effort or change focus, and determine whether NASA should pursue work in any new MMOD areas.

R&D professionals are known for keeping their knowledge work within clearly defined boundaries, protecting it from individuals outside those boundaries, and rejecting meritorious innovation that is created outside disciplinary boundaries. The open innovation model challenges these boundaries and opens the knowledge work to be conducted by anyone who chooses to contribute. At NASA, the open model led to a scientific breakthrough at unprecedented speed using unusually limited resources; yet it challenged not only the knowledge-work boundaries but also the professional identity of the R&D professionals. This led to divergent reactions from R&D professionals, as adopting the open model required them to go through a multifaceted transformation. Only R&D professionals who underwent identity refocusing work dismantled their boundaries, truly adopting the knowledge from outside and sharing their internal knowledge. Others who did not go through that identity work failed to incorporate the solutions the open model produced. Adopting open innovation without a change in R&D professionals’ identity resulted in no real change in the R&D process.

The first task of this study is the stakeholder analysis. The goal of the stakeholder analysis is to identify the main stakeholders of the SCaN system and their needs. Twenty-one main groups of stakeholders have been identified and put on a stakeholder map. Their needs are currently being elicited by means of interviews and an extensive literature review.

The second task of this study is the architectural tradespace exploration of the next generation TDRSS. The space of possible architectures for SCaN is represented by a set of architectural decisions, each of which has a discrete set of options. A computational tool is used to automatically synthesize a very large number of possible architectures by enumerating different combinations of decisions and options. The same tool contains models to evaluate the architectures in terms of performance and cost. The performance model uses the stakeholder needs and requirements identified in the previous steps as inputs, and it is based in the VASSAR methodology presented in a companion paper.

Barnes', 'The transition to new technology, innovative ideas, and resistance to change is something that every industry experiences. Recent examples of this shift are changing to using robots in the assembly line construction of automobiles or the increasing use of robotics for medical procedures. Most often this is done with cost-reduction in mind, though ease of use for the customer is also a driver. All industries experience the push to increase efficiency of their systems; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the commercial space industry are no different. NASA space communication services are provided by three separately designed, developed, maintained, and operated communications networks known as the Deep Space Network (DSN), Near Earth Network (NEN) and Space Network (SN). The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program is pursuing integration of these networks and has performed a variety of architecture trade studies to determine what integration options would be the most effective in achieving a unified user mission support organization, and increase the use of common operational equipment and processes. The integration of multiple, legacy organizations and existing systems has challenges ranging from technical to cultural. The existing networks are the progeny of the very first communication and tracking capabilities implemented by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) more than 50 years ago and have been customized to the needs of their respective user mission base. The technical challenges to integrating the networks are many, though not impossible to overcome. The three distinct networks provide the same types of services, with customizable data rates, bandwidth, frequencies, and so forth. The differences across the networks have occurred in effort to satisfy their user missions needs. Each new requirement has made the networks more unique and harder to integrate. The cultural challenges, however, have proven to be a significant obstacle for integration. Over the past few decades of use, user missions and network personnel alike have grown accustomed to the processes by which services are provided by the NASA communications and navigation networks. The culture established by each network has created several challenges that need to be overcome in order to effectively integrate the networks. As with any change, there has been resistance, an apprehension to explore automation of existing processes, and a working environment that attempts to indirectly influence change without mandating compliance. Overcoming technical and cultural challenges is essential to successfully integrating the networks and although the challenges are numerous, the integration of the networks promises a more efficient space communications network for NASA and its customers, as well as potential long-term cost savings to the agency.This paper, Challenges of Integrating NASA Legacy Communications Networks, will provide a brief overview of the current NASA space communications networks as well as the an overview of the process implemented while performing the SCaN Trade Studies and an introduction to the requirements driving integration of the SCaN Networks.

Recent emphasis has been placed on the usage of four so-called \"BET consistency criteria.\" Using these criteria and simulated nitrogen isotherms for perfect crystals, we calculated BET areas for graphene and 25 MOFs having different pore-size distributions. BET areas were compared with their corresponding geometrically calculated, nitrogen-accessible surface areas (NASAs). Analysis of simulation snapshots elucidated the contributions of \"pore-filling\" and \"monolayer-formation\" to the nitrogen adsorption loadings in different MOF pores, revealing the origin of inaccuracies in BET-calculated monolayer loadings, which largely explain discrepancies between BET areas and NASAs. We also find that even if all consistency criteria are satisfied, the BET calculation can significantly overestimate the true monolayer loading, especially in MOFs combining mesopores (d ≥ 20 Å) and large micropores (d = 10-20 Å), due to the overlap of pore-filling and monolayer-formation regimes of these two kinds of pores. While it is not always possible to satisfy all consistency criteria, it is critical to minimize the deviation from these criteria during BET range selection to consistently compare BET areas of different MOFs and for comparing simulated and experimental BET areas of a given MOF. To accurately assess the quality of a MOF sample, it is best to compare experimental BET areas with simulated BET areas rather than with calculated NASAs.', '2016', 119, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nasas&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

Bizzarro', 'Chondrules, tiny spheres found in primitive meteorites, accumulate through gas drag to form asteroids and planetary embryos. Chondrules are millimeter-sized spherules that dominate primitive meteorites (chondrites) originating from the asteroid belt. The incorporation of chondrules into asteroidal bodies must be an important step in planet formation, but the mechanism is not understood. We show that the main growth of asteroids can result from gas drag–assisted accretion of chondrules. The largest planetesimals of a population with a characteristic radius of 100 km undergo runaway accretion of chondrules within ~3 My, forming planetary embryos up to Mars’s size along with smaller asteroids whose size distribution matches that of main belt asteroids. The aerodynamical accretion leads to size sorting of chondrules consistent with chondrites. Accretion of millimeter-sized chondrules and ice particles drives the growth of planetesimals beyond the ice line as well, but the growth time increases above the disc lifetime outside of 25 AU. The contribution of direct planetesimal accretion to the growth of both asteroids and Kuiper belt objects is minor. In contrast, planetesimal accretion and chondrule accretion play more equal roles in the formation of Moon-sized embryos in the terrestrial planet formation region. These embryos are isolated from each other and accrete planetesimals only at a low rate. However, the continued accretion of chondrules destabilizes the oligarchic configuration and leads to the formation of Mars-sized embryos and terrestrial planets by a combination of direct chondrule accretion and giant impacts.', '2015', 269, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroids&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

Models predict that numerous asteroids should be found on orbits that closely approach the Sun, but few have been seen. In addition, even though the near-Earth-object population in general is an even mix of low-albedo (less than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected) and high-albedo (more than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected) asteroids, the characterized asteroids near the Sun typically have high albedos. Here we report a quantitative comparison of actual asteroid detections and a near-Earth-object model (which accounts for observational selection effects). We conclude that the deficit of low-albedo objects near the Sun arises from the super-catastrophic breakup (that is, almost complete disintegration) of a substantial fraction of asteroids when they achieve perihelion distances of a few tens of solar radii. The distance at which destruction occurs is greater for smaller asteroids, and their temperatures during perihelion passages are too low for evaporation to explain their disappearance. Although both bright and dark (high- and low-albedo) asteroids eventually break up, we find that low-albedo asteroids are more likely to be destroyed farther from the Sun, which explains the apparent excess of high-albedo near-Earth objects and suggests that low-albedo asteroids break up more easily as a result of thermal effects.', '2016', 132, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroids&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

The locations of the escape routes are likewise unaffected when we added a model for Yarkovsky-O’Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) cycles coupled with secular evolution of the rotation pole as a result of the solar gravitational torque. A Yarkovsky-only model predicts a flux of asteroids entering the NEO region that is too high compared to the observationally constrained flux, and the discrepancy grows larger for smaller asteroids.

Regolith generation has traditionally been attributed to the fall back of impact ejecta and by the break-up of boulders by micrometeoroid impact. Laboratory experiments and impact models, however, show that crater ejecta velocities are typically greater than several tens of centimetres per second, which corresponds to the gravitational escape velocity of kilometre-sized asteroids. Therefore, impact debris cannot be the main source of regolith on small asteroids. Here we report that thermal fatigue, a mechanism of rock weathering and fragmentation with no subsequent ejection, is the dominant process governing regolith generation on small asteroids. We find that thermal fragmentation induced by the diurnal temperature variations breaks up rocks larger than a few centimetres more quickly than do micrometeoroid impacts. Because thermal fragmentation is independent of asteroid size, this process can also contribute to regolith production on larger asteroids. Production of fresh regolith originating in thermal fatigue fragmentation may be an important process for the rejuvenation of the surfaces of near-Earth asteroids, and may explain the observed lack of low-perihelion, carbonaceous, near-Earth asteroids.', '2014', 222, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroids&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

A considerable amount of information regarding the processes that occurred during the accretion of the early planetesimals is still present among this population. A review of our current knowledge of the density of small bodies is presented here. Density is indeed a fundamental property for the understanding of their composition and internal structure. Intrinsic physical properties of small bodies are sought by searching for relationships between the dynamical and taxonomic classes, size, and density. Mass and volume estimates for 287 small bodies (asteroids, comets, and transneptunian objects) are collected from the literature. The accuracy and biases affecting the methods used to estimate these quantities are discussed and best-estimates are strictly selected. Bulk densities are subsequently computed and compared with meteorite density, allowing to estimate the macroporosity (i.e., amount of voids) within these bodies. Dwarf-planets apparently have no macroporosity, while smaller bodies ( 400 km ) can have large voids. This trend is apparently correlated with size: C- and S-complex asteroids tend to have larger density with increasing diameter. The average density of each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes is computed (DeMeo et al., 2009; Icarus 202). S-complex asteroids are more dense on average than those in the C-complex that in turn have a larger macroporosity, although both complexes partly overlap. Within the C-complex asteroids, B-types stand out in albedo, reflectance spectra, and density, indicating a unique composition and structure. Asteroids in the X-complex span a wide range of densities, suggesting that many compositions are included in the complex. Comets and TNOs have high macroporosity and low density, supporting the current models of internal structures made of icy aggregates. Although the number of density estimates sky-rocketed during last decade from a handful to 287, only a third of the estimates are more precise than 20%.

Alexander et al. (p. 721, published online 12 July) estimated the hydrogen isotopic compositions in 86 samples of primitive meteorites that fell in Antarctica and compared the results to those of comets and Saturns moon, Enceladus. Water in primitive meteorites was less deuteriumrich than that in comets and Enceladus, implying that, in contradiction to recent models of the dynamical evolution of the solar system, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites cannot have formed in the same region as comets. The results also suggest that comets were not the principal source of Earths water. Hydrogen isotopic analysis of primitive meteorites implicates asteroids as early sources of Earth’s water. Determining the source(s) of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen accreted by Earth is important for understanding the origins of water and life and for constraining dynamical processes that operated during planet formation. Chondritic meteorites are asteroidal fragments that retain records of the first few million years of solar system history. The deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) values of water in carbonaceous chondrites are distinct from those in comets and Saturn’s moon Enceladus, implying that they formed in a different region of the solar system, contrary to predictions of recent dynamical models. The D/H values of water in carbonaceous chondrites also argue against an influx of water ice from the outer solar system, which has been invoked to explain the nonsolar oxygen isotopic composition of the inner solar system.

We found that the boulder’s thermal inertia was much lower than anticipated based on laboratory measurements of meteorites, and that a surface covered by such low-conductivity boulders would be consistent with remote-sensing observations.

The Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT) landed on Ryugu’s surface on 3 October 2018. We present images from the MASCOT camera (MASCam) taken during the descent and while on the surface. The surface is covered by decimeter- to meter-sized rocks, with no deposits of fine-grained material. Rocks appear either bright, with smooth faces and sharp edges, or dark, with a cauliflower-like, crumbly surface. Close-up images of a rock of the latter type reveal a dark matrix with small, bright, spectrally different inclusions, implying that it did not experience extensive aqueous alteration. The inclusions appear similar to those in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.', '2019', 65, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroid&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

The other two New Frontiers missions are New Horizons, which explored Pluto during a flyby in July 2015 and is on its way for a flyby of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019, and Juno, an orbiting mission that is studying the origin, evolution, and internal structure of Jupiter. The spacecraft departed for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu aboard an United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 evolved expendable launch vehicle at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016, on a seven-year journey to return samples from Bennu. The spacecraft is on an outbound-cruise trajectory that will result in a rendezvous with Bennu in November 2018. The science instruments on the spacecraft will survey Bennu to measure its physical, geological, and chemical properties, and the team will use these data to select a site on the surface to collect at least 60 g of asteroid regolith. The team will also analyze the remote-sensing data to perform a detailed study of the sample site for context, assess Bennu’s resource potential, refine estimates of its impact probability with Earth, and provide ground-truth data for the extensive astronomical data set collected on this asteroid. The spacecraft will leave Bennu in 2021 and return the sample to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 24, 2023.', '2017', 251, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroid&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

Petric, L. Denneau, E. Magnier, T. Berger, M. Huber, H. Flewelling, C. Waters, Eva Schunova-Lilly, S. Chastel', 'None of the approximately 750,000 known asteroids and comets in the Solar System is thought to have originated outside it, despite models of the formation of planetary systems suggesting that orbital migration of giant planets ejects a large fraction of the original planetesimals into interstellar space. The high predicted number density of icy interstellar objects (2.4 × 10−4 per cubic astronomical unit) suggests that some should have been detected, yet hitherto none has been seen. Many decades of asteroid and comet characterization have yielded formation models that explain the mass distribution, chemical abundances and planetary configuration of the Solar System today, but there has been no way of telling whether the Solar System is typical of planetary systems. Here we report observations and analysis of the object 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua) that demonstrate its extrasolar trajectory, and that thus enable comparisons to be made between material from another planetary system and from our own. Our observations during the brief visit by the object to the inner Solar System reveal it to be asteroidal, with no hint of cometary activity despite an approach within 0.25 astronomical units of the Sun. Spectroscopic measurements show that the surface of the object is spectrally red, consistent with comets or organic-rich asteroids that reside within the Solar System. Light-curve observations indicate that the object has an extremely oblong shape, with a length about ten times its width, and a mean radius of about 102 metres assuming an albedo of 0.04. No known objects in the Solar System have such extreme dimensions. The presence of ‘Oumuamua in the Solar System suggests that previous estimates of the number density of interstellar objects, based on the assumption that all such objects were cometary, were pessimistically low. Planned upgrades to contemporary asteroid survey instruments and improved data processing techniques are likely to result in the detection of more interstellar objects in the coming years.', '2017', 191, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroid&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

P', 'The European component of the joint ESA-NASA Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission has been redesigned from the original version called Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), and is now called Hera. The main objectives of AIDA are twofold: (1) to perform an asteroid deflection test by means of a kinetic impactor under detailed study at NASA (called DART, for Double Asteroid Redirection Test); and (2) to investigate with Hera the changes in geophysical and dynamical properties of the target binary asteroid after the DART impact. This joint mission will allow extrapolating the results of the kinetic impact to other asteroids and therefore fully validate such asteroid deflection techniques. Hera leverages technology and payload pre-developments of the previous AIM, and focuses on key measurements to validate impact models such as the detailed characterisation of the impact crater. As such, AIDA will be the first documented deflection experiment and binary asteroid investigation. In particular, it will be the first mission to investigate a binary asteroid, and return new scientific knowledge with important implications for our understanding of asteroid formation and solar system history. Hera will investigate the smallest asteroid visited so far therefore providing a unique opportunity to shed light on the role cohesion and Van der Waals forces may play in the formation and resulting internal structure of such small bodies.', '2018', 68, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroid&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

NASA plans to provide the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission which will perform a kinetic impactor experiment to demonstrate asteroid impact hazard mitigation. ESA proposes to provide the Hera mission which will rendezvous with the target to monitor the deflection, perform detailed characterizations, and measure the DART impact outcomes and momentum transfer efficiency. The primary goals of AIDA are (i) to demonstrate the kinetic impact technique on a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid and (ii) to measure and characterize the deflection caused by the impact. The AIDA target will be the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos, which is of spectral type Sq, with the deflection experiment to occur in October, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the binary at ∼6 km/s changes the orbital speed and the binary orbit period, which can be measured by Earth-based observatories with telescope apertures as small as 1 m. The DART impact will in addition alter the orbital and rotational states of the Didymos binary, leading to excitation of eccentricity and libration that, if measured by Hera, can constrain internal structure of the target asteroid. Measurements of the DART crater diameter and morphology can constrain target properties like cohesion and porosity based on numerical simulations of the DART impact.', '2018', 62, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroid&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),
