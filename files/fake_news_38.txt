Under anonymity, a clinic examined blood cells of a patient before and after receiving the injections. You can see the progression of the cells as the appear normal in the initial image. Nine days later they are observed to be jagged in appearance, irregular, and beginning to coagulate. A week after that, there is very increased coagulation.

Note: Ignore the dates on the images. They do not correlate to the dates of the microscopic examinations of the cells, which were captured in November and early December.     Initial Microscopic View of Red Blood Cells    9 Days after mRNA injection    16 days after mRNA injection

After posting this information, I researched possible reasons for the jagged  appearance of blood cells. I came across articles that describe them as  schisocytes, known as fragmented blood cells. They can be the result of the cells moving through obstructions in small blood vessels. I believe it&#8217;s plausible that since the spike proteins sit on the outer portion of the cell &#8211; to include vessel walls &#8211; that the arrival of antibodies and macrophages could obstruct the normal blood flow and create damage to the blood cells. This could also result in the clotting that we&#8217;re seeing. Here are additional details about schisocytes.

The lifespan of a red blood cell is approx 4 months.  This needs follow up after 4 months to see if new blood cells continue to exhibit the deformation or if it&#8217;s a one time event that only affects cells present in blood stream at the time of the vaccine. And some research needs to be done on spread of the lipid particles to see if they persist in the body over time or eventually get purged.

Andrew, my &#8220;ability (if any)&#8221; was simply looking at the frames. 2 had timestamps in reverse order &#8211; the 3rd did not have a timestamp. As it&#8217;s implied the timestamps are from the microscope, the first 2 could not be from the same patient. The 3rd has no timestamp, implying a different lab/microscope. Now that we know the timestamp is NOT from the lab, all this is mute anyway.

OH WOW! Really? Well, this isnt just one person with coagulated, red blood cells that look like glowing triangles. No, there are MANY, MANY others. Even if this was done Nov-Dec, so what? This just means this person is one of the first responders that was given this crap when it was first available. Does this mean that nothing nefarious is going on? Well, hell no! So why is everyone thinking shit is all fine and dandy?

I don&#8217;t understand why every doctor or researcher in the country isn&#8217;t examining your blood pre and post vaccine. I also don&#8217;t understand why a person that dies within 14 days of being vaccinated isn&#8217;t considered a vaccinated death? I really don&#8217;t care about the date stamp on the picture of three different individuals. why isn&#8217;t this on the news. Its an experimental vaccine so lets study it! No doubt thousands are dead within 14 days of being vaccinated.
 The public that trust this medical system and sees massive deaths from screwing up our DNA is going to be mad as hell when they figure out who lied to them, who promoted the lie and who profited from the lie.

@Cary I noticed the same thing with the dates on the images. They don&#8217;t match up to the claimed # of days passed&#8230; And even if these are 3 different samples, then the data is skewed because it&#8217;s not showing a real story.

It was speculation and in either case they are abnormal cells. It is alarming to see that change, don&#8217;t you think?  Also, did you ever review the results of the animal trials?

Well Scott I would agree with the 4 month thing but 4 months is the average lifespan of a red blood cell. but no matter what are we so sure these people will even be around for 4 months. blood cells like that tend to stick in the tiniest capillaries in your body and those are usually around and in the most vital of organs. to include the lungs, heart and brain. Given that this is alarming considering that this is after the M-RNA shot. blood should not look like that ever. 				  				Reply			 		   		 			 				 					 												Steve Walton says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 11:56 am					  									  				Why does the video timestamp go from 5/11/21 to 5/05/21, and why are the color gammas so different on the last two (implying different instrument)? And, &#8220;a clinic&#8221; isn&#8217;t very specific.

Though I might believe this series of events, this report shows no evidence of vetting, despite the headline. There is little to no evidence in the images themselves that these represent a progression in a single patient.

Those aren&#8217;t the dates the microscope images were captured. They are from November and December. You have every right to be skeptical. Clinics aren&#8217;t going to publicly release information like this in our current environment of cancelling everyone. Consider this though &#8211; the images are consistent with the effects we&#8217;re seeing &#8211; blood clots, strokes, migraines, heart inflammation, menstrual issues, brain fog. I believe them to be authentic for that reason, and Sarah does ethical reporting. I have no reason not to trust her.

Thank you Lynne for the clarification. I just wish the &#8220;date issue&#8221; was addressed in the initial post. Looking at the frames, the &#8220;date stamp&#8221; appears to come from the lab. Obviously, the &#8220;pro vaccine&#8221; mob would jump on this as proof of misinformation. 				  				Reply			 		 		 			 				 					 												Lynne says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 1:24 pm					  									  				Yes, I understand it can be misleading. I trust Sarah though and don&#8217;t believe she would publish photoshopped images. There&#8217;s very little to gain. It&#8217;s very concerning because we know people are experiencing severe blood related issues following the shots. My heart sinks when someone close to me tells me they got them.

Edited to add: I researched reasons for this appearance of jagged cells and I will edit my blog post to include it. It&#8217;s caused by them being torn/damaged by difficulty moving through small vessels easily. I suspect spike proteins are causing obstructions.

While the two dates may be suspect, it appears that the three images were taken by a camera or phone-cam, on different parts of the display screen.  As if I pulled up an image on the internet (or somewhere) and took a photo of my monitor with my phone.  The date fonts look exactly the same, but the camera was positioned differently in each one.  The color discrepancies look to be the result of the monitor the original images are displayed on.  If you notice the first one had a reddish tint, the second more greenish, and the third seems to have both, making it seem like the edges of the display have a problem, maybe with angle of view.  It&#8217;s possible the person taking the images took the &#8220;after&#8221; one first, and then realized they needed the &#8220;before&#8221; to compare it to, thereby leading to the date differences.  This doesn&#8217;t tell us when or where the three images were initially rendered (that is the microscope or lab or whatever).

I was in the hospital earlier this year, one of my roommates had lost 50% of his blood and the doctors didn’t know how or why. The patient said that he noticed a small amount of blood in his stool one day but nothing remotely like the 50% blood loss. He causally mentioned that he had just had his second jab a couple of weeks ago and it knocked him on his ass. The three doctors in the room made no connection or comment linking it to his life threatening problem. On top of that his body was not creating any new blood to replace what he lost. He had a somewhat of a rare blood type and the hospital was only able to give him 2 transfusions. It didn’t help him at all, he was in for about a week and after a bunch of tests, they sent him home and gave him a prescription for iron pills. ‘He was still in the same shape as when he came in.  They also said if it happened to him again, he’d be dead.. 				  				Reply			 		 		 			 				 					 												Lynne says: 					  					 						June 22, 2021 at 10:38 pm

Every device in the hospital has the name of the hospital (or laboratory) and the patient on the images!
 It is clear that they then either manipulated the images or downloaded images of identical results from the Internet, in order to remain anonymous, avoid sanctions and not violate the patient&#8217;s privacy &#8230;.
