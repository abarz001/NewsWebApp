The department instructed people to change the voicemail on their phone before the battery dies with a message that includes your approximate location, time, date and a description of the situation. If you plan to stay in the area or walk towards another location, include those details, too, the department said.

“The best part of this is that even if your cell phone dies or stops working, voicemail still works,” the department wrote in a Facebook post.
