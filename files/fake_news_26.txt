"No Turkey for Thanksgiving this year," said one such  uploaded Oct. 12.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our .) 

Some Facebook users who reacted to the post blamed President Joe Biden for the crazy cost the viral image showed, leaving comments such as "inflation is killing us" and "thanks Joe." 

An Oct. 12 Facebook post falsely claimed this old photo was "this year."  Featured Fact-check                  stated on October 13, 2021 in a tweet                    By Bill McCarthy • October 13, 2021

But while supply chain backlogs  the cost and availability of Thanksgiving turkeys, the photo of a $123,000 bird at Target is several years old — and it’s nowhere near reflective of the true cost of a frozen turkey at the retail and grocery giant, which is many times lower.

PolitiFact found the same photo posted in November 2015 on  and the image sharing service . The price tag in the photo also includes an expiration date of April 15, 2016. 

The price tag lists a Target store at the Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis as the location of the photo, and PolitiFact confirmed that the pricing was an error at a single store in 2015. The Reddit user who appears to have first uploaded the image in November of that year wrote on the forum that he brought the turkey to a cashier, but "the ticket didn’t have a barcode to scan."

The $123,000 price is exponentially higher than the cost of a frozen turkey at Target — or at other U.S. grocery stores, according to  from the . 

Target’s website  that similarly sized frozen turkeys are going for a max price of about $23 at the same location in Minneapolis, and $1.39 per pound.
