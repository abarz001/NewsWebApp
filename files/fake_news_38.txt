Under anonymity, a clinic examined blood cells of a patient before and after receiving the injections. You can see the progression of the cells as the appear normal in the initial image. Nine days later they are observed to be jagged in appearance, irregular, and beginning to coagulate. A week after that, there is very increased coagulation.

Note: Ignore the dates on the images. They do not correlate to the dates of the microscopic examinations of the cells, which were captured in November and early December.     Initial Microscopic View of Red Blood Cells    9 Days after mRNA injection    16 days after mRNA injection

After posting this information, I researched possible reasons for the jagged  appearance of blood cells. I came across articles that describe them as  , known as fragmented blood cells. They can be the result of the cells moving through obstructions in small blood vessels. I believe it&#8217;s plausible that since the spike proteins sit on the outer portion of the cell &#8211; to include vessel walls &#8211; that the arrival of antibodies and macrophages could obstruct the normal blood flow and create damage to the blood cells. This could also result in the clotting that we&#8217;re seeing. are additional details about schisocytes.                 			 			 			Share this:Like this:Like   Loading...    	Related
