Claims that sprayed-on chemicals could cause chemical burns in some pets circulated through social media in a variety of platforms and methods, including Reddit and Twitter. In particular, Snopes readers sent our team the below post shared by a woman named Debora Berger with the Facebook group Yorkie Lovers.\n\nBerger told Snopes that she had contacted the original poster ‚Äî a woman by the name of Alicia Plant ‚Äî who first shared the pictures of her cat that had allegedly experienced chemical burns after licking Amazon boxes. Snopes subsequently contacted Plant, who confirmed that she had initially shared the photo to social media but had since deleted it.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to bash Amazon. I love Amazon and I have deleted my post bc of all the hate,‚Äù Plant told Snopes in a Facebook message. ‚ÄúAmazon and I have been in contact and I do not wish to speak about it as it is being handled by them. Have a nice day.‚Äù\n\nIn an interview with Snopes, Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that the company does not have a policy of spraying their packaging boxes with any sort of rodenticide or insecticide.\n\n‚ÄúBoxes aren‚Äôt sprayed for any reason. If somewhere down the supply chain are they sprayed? The answer to that is no,‚Äù said Seay. ‚ÄúCorrugated boxes are made of wood pulp and wood pulp binders, which is basically what all manufacturers make their boxes out of. So, we don‚Äôt have special boxes. They are essentially the same thing that every other manufacturer uses.‚Äù\n\nCorrugated cardboard boxes are made of paper and represent one of the most recycled products in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Garbage and recycling service provider Waste Management noted that corrugated shipping boxes like those used by Amazon are made of recycled materials or lumber industry byproducts, such as sawdust. When recycled, cardboard materials are re-pulped, separated, bleached, and screened and cleaned to eliminate contaminants.\n\nIn 2019, it was estimated that Amazon shipped around 2.5 billion packages around the world every year. But during the 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic, Amazon upped its global shipping fleet and expanded its shipping flight activity by at least 30% since April 2020, according to a report published in September by the Chicago-based Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development.\n\n\r\n          			                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      		          	                                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                                               	  	\n\nQUICK LINKS  	  	  	                                                            	  	\n\nABOUT US  	  	  	                                                                         	  	\n\nCONTACT US  	  	  	Contact Person : Miss Gloria Bao\n\nTel : +86-579-85792908\n\nE-mail : sales1@jialanpackage.com\n\nWechat : +86-18757869290\r\n Whatsapp :+86-18757869290                                                                                                                                                                            \n\nCopyright ¬© 2021 Yiwu Jialan Package Co, LTD. | All Rights Reserved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	 		 	    	 	  	 		 			 		 		Chat Online  		ÁºñËæëÊ®°Âºè‰∏ãÊó†Ê≥ï‰ΩøÁî® 	 	 		 			 			Chat Online  			inputting...

All rights reserved.SearchStakeholders Topics Institute for Value-Based Medicine About AJMC \n\n¬© 2021 MJH Life Sciences‚Ñ¢  and Clinical Care Targeted Communications, LLC. All rights reserved.June 24, 2021  The American Journal of Managed Care,  July 2021,  Volume 27,  Issue 7\n\nWas it natural zoonotic spillover that catapulted SARS-CoV-2 from an emerging virus into a pandemic pathogen or was it something much more sinister? Is it at all possible that a lab leak in Wuhan, China, was the spark that lit the fuse?\n\nDebate and discussion about the origin of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been at the forefront of the global consciousness since the first cases were reported in December 2019.\n\nEarly on, whispers of a potentially engineered virus quickly grew to a roar and fueled speculation that China was behind the pandemic. This narrative was so pervasive that, in February 2020, a group of 27 public health scientists  a letter in The Lancet disputing the lab leak theory and announcing their support of their counterparts in China: the scientists, public health officials, and medical professionals combating the pandemic.\n\n‚ÄúThe rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumors and misinformation around its origins,‚Äù wrote the authors, who all declared no competing interests in their disclosures as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. ‚ÄúWe stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.‚Äù\n\nAnd although it‚Äôs true that analyses of the genomic sequence of the virus subsequently pointed to natural origins, the questions regarding China‚Äôs role persisted, led by pesky discrepancies and conflicting reports.\n\nFast forward to June 2021 and new evidence that has breathed new life into those origin questions. In an update to the February 2020 letter, The Lancet has  an addendum with revised disclosure statements from virologist and investigator Peter Daszak, PhD, one of the 27 authors. In the revised document, Daszak noted that his remuneration is paid solely in the form of a salary from EcoHealth Alliance, a New York‚Äìbased nonprofit research foundation of which he is president. The company has reportedly worked directly with Wuhan laboratories and funded gain-of-function research at China‚Äôs Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nConsider, too, other odd associations. Recent reports have uncovered financial ties between Google and EcoHealth Alliance. This comes after accusations that the tech giant was censoring lab leak ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù stories in its search results. Google‚Äôs health lead, David Feinberg, MD, has dismissed those reports, insisting that the company is simply taking steps to protect users from unverified information.\n\nAre these coincidences or ‚Äúwhere there‚Äôs smoke, there‚Äôs fire‚Äù situations? It‚Äôs unclear. But they add to the bank of troublesome questions standing in the way of the truth about COVID-19.\n\nThe questions extend beyond origin theory, though. With the FDA‚Äôs green lighting of vaccines for adolescents and young adults comes hesitation over long-term effects: Is there any effect on fertility? Do the vaccines cause heart inflammation? Robert Malone, MD, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology, has expressed concern over the risk-benefit analysis of vaccination for young adults. The CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently met to discuss extremely rare instances of myocarditis or pericarditis in people 30 years and younger who have received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, although it emphasized that the heart risks from contracting the virus are far greater.Of course, the answer to our ultimate question is that we may never know.\n\nWe may never know where this virus came from. We may never know what triggered the global pandemic that has claimed more than 3.8 million lives. And we won‚Äôt know the long-term effects until enough time has elapsed. What we do know for certain is that the incredible strength and collaboration of the scientific community have allowed us to regain some semblance of normalcy. The development and rollout of multiple effective vaccine options have been the medical miracle of our lifetime.\n\nThat, right now, will have to be the only answer that matters.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nMike Hennessy Sr\n\nChairman and Founder\n\nMJH Life Sciences‚Ñ¢Download RIS', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fauci-gain-function-covid/'),

PRICE and KEN RITTER January 23, 2019 GMT LAS VEGAS (AP) ‚Äî A man suspected of being in the U.S. illegally shot and killed four people in Nevada over the past two weeks, including an elderly Reno couple, authorities said, and the slayings added fuel to the immigration debate.\n\nWilbur Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, 19, from El Salvador, has been jailed in Carson City since Saturday on possession of stolen property, burglary and immigration charges. Authorities said they expect to file murder charges against him in Reno in the shooting deaths of a Washoe County couple and in Douglas County in the slayings of two women in Gardnerville.ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said federal immigration authorities told his office that Martinez-Guzman was in the country illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not have details on his entry into the U.S.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, the sheriff said, and it was too early to comment on a possible motive.\n\nInvestigators who had been tracking Martinez-Guzman considered him ‚Äúan imminent threat‚Äù when they arrested him Saturday afternoon in the parking lot of a shopping mall.\n\n‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt account for him Friday night, and we couldn‚Äôt predict what he would do Saturday night,‚Äù Furlong told The Associated Press. ‚ÄúIt was too great a risk to the public not to make the arrest.‚Äù\n\nDetectives had watched Martinez-Guzman go to a car wash and trash bins, raising concern that he might try to dispose of evidence connected to the slayings. He did not have a weapon when he was handcuffed, the sheriff said.\n\nThe suspect did not yet have an attorney who could speak on his behalf, according to the sheriff.\n\nPresident Donald Trump seized on the killings as evidence of the need for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\n‚ÄúFour people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,‚Äù Trump said Monday in a tweet. ‚ÄúWe need a powerful Wall!‚Äù\n\nThe killings are the latest crimes Trump has cited to bring attention to the wall, which is at the center of his battle with Democrats that has shut down much of the federal government.\n\nSince the start of his presidency, he has highlighted crimes committed by immigrants who were here illegally, including the killing of a 32-year-old woman at a San Francisco pier in 2015. Last month, he tweeted about allegations that a man from Mexico fatally shot a California police officer.ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany academics and Trump‚Äôs critics have pushed back on the president‚Äôs narrative, citing studies that have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.\n\nThe Nevada suspect, who was due in court Thursday, had lived in the Carson City area for about a year. His only known infraction was a speeding ticket, the sheriff said.\n\n‚ÄúWe have no information this guy has ever been on anyone‚Äôs radar,‚Äù Furlong said.\n\nThe investigation began Jan. 10, when 56-year-old Connie Koontz was found dead in her home. Three days later, the body of 74-year-old Sophia Renken was discovered in her home about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from where Koontz lived, authorities said.\n\nOn Jan. 16, the bodies of 81-year-old Gerald David and his 80-year-old wife, Sharon, were found in their home on the southern edge of Reno.\n\nThe two were remembered as ‚Äújovial‚Äù by Tom Cates, a longtime friend who knew the Davids through Reno‚Äôs rodeo and equestrian scene.\n\nCates said Gerald David used his time as the Reno Rodeo Association president in 2006 to promote a breast cancer awareness campaign by getting the group‚Äôs cowboys to show they were ‚Äútough enough to wear pink shirts.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou walk into a room and his presence will just command attention. He was a true leader,‚Äù Cates said.\n\nSharon David was ‚Äúexuberant‚Äù and ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù and ‚Äúloved animals to the hills,‚Äù he said. She was a former director of the rodeo.\n\nRenken belonged to an antique automobile club and was known as the friendly driver of a Ford Model A who was always volunteering to help.\n\nRobin Reedy, who was also in the Carson-Tahoe Region of the Antique Automobile Club of America, said she was surprised to learn Renken‚Äôs age.\n\n‚ÄúI would never have known she was 74 by the way she acted,‚Äù she said.\n\nKoontz, who worked at a Walmart and as a manicurist at a local salon, was remembered by co-workers Tuesday as a positive woman who loved wearing bright colors. Her Walmart colleagues wore memorial buttons with her picture.\n\nShe was ‚Äúthe only person I know that could come to work wearing lime green glasses and lime green crocs and rock it,‚Äù said Teri Bower, who works at the store.\n\nKoontz and her daughter were best friends, Bower said, and the mother had saved up money and surprised her daughter with a trip to Las Vegas for her 21st birthday in December.\n\nBower said the killings had shaken the quiet community where everyone knows everyone and big news is a pending storm ‚Äúor a bear running down Main Street.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis does not happen around here,‚Äù Bower said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the suspect‚Äôs age to 19, not 20.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Las Vegas, Elliot Spagat in San Diego and AP researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this story.AP NEWSDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APFollow APThe Associated PressAll contents ¬© copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

As we investigate this Map, the stakes are high.  As it deals with the history of our country, we do become emotionally involved.\n\nReputable scholars - map historians, Norse historians, Latin specialists, conservation scientists, physicists, chemists, and so on - have been engaged in and enraged by the Vinland Map for over 40 years.   (Only this morning (1/19/07) did I learn that yet another worthless paper will be published on the Vinland Map and that this will dirty the waters needlessly for another 5 years!)   Why cannot the best talent and the best equipment not solve this problem for once and for all?\n\nThat is where you step in.   You can succeed where the experts have so miserably failed.  This web site gives you all the evidence.  It is up to you to use that evidence to construct an argument that will specify unequivocally the Maps status.  The pedagogical purpose of this web site is to help you reason.  It just happens that the Vinland Map is a convenient vehicle to help you achieve this.  That said, we are also interested in finding out if the Map is genuine or fake.\n\nThe best possible introduction to the world of the Vinland Map is the NOVA program The Viking Deception, see .  This routes you to buying the VHS or DVD at~$20 but it contains much additional material of great interest.  The NOVA site does not set out to achieve what we achieve here.  It does not point you on the way to review methodically all the relevant evidence.  The NOVA site sets out to engage your interest.  It is difficult to imagine it being done better.\n\nIf you are viewing this as a class assignment, your teacher will have access to the material in the Teachers Guide.

Bloomberg via Getty Images, FILE The Biden administration on Tuesday backed down on a controversial proposal to direct the IRS to collect additional data on every bank account that sees more than $600 in annual transactions, after widespread criticism from Republican lawmakers and banking industry representatives, who said the tax enforcement strategy represented a breach of privacy by the federal government.\n\nInstead, the administration and Senate Democrats are proposing to raise the threshold to accounts with more than $10,000 in annual transactions, and any income received through a paycheck from which federal taxes are automatically deducted will not be subject to the reporting. Recipients of federal benefits like unemployment and Social Security would also be exempt.\n\nThe IRS would collect the total sum of deposits and withdrawals from bank accounts with more than $10,000 in non-payroll income. Information on individual transactions would not be collected.\n\nThe changes were announced Tuesday by the Treasury Department.\n\n\"In response to considerations about scope, it [Congress] has crafted a new approach to include an exemption for wage and salary earners and federal program beneficiaries. Under this revised approach, such earners can be completely carved out of the reporting structure. This is a well-reasoned modification: for American workers and retirees, the IRS already has information on wage and salary income and the federal benefits they receive,\" a Treasury Department fact sheet on the changes said.\n\nThe changes would exempt millions of Americans from the reporting requirement, and help the IRS target wealthier Americans, especially those who earn money from investments, real estate, and other transactions that are more difficult for the IRS to track.\n\n\"Under the current system, American workers pay virtually all their tax bills while many top earners avoid paying billions in the taxes they owe by exploiting the system. At the core of the problem is a discrepancy in the ways types of income are reported to the IRS: opaque income sources frequently avoid scrutiny while wages and federal benefits are typically subject to nearly full compliance. This two-tiered tax system is unfair and deprives the country of resources to fund core priorities,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Michael Reynolds/EPA via Shutterstock, FILE Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen watches as President Joe Biden speaks during a meeting with members of his administration and business leaders in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington, Oct. 6, 2021.\n\n\"Today‚Äôs new proposal reflects the Administration‚Äôs strong belief that we should zero in on those at the top of the income scale who don‚Äôt pay the taxes they owe, while protecting American workers by setting the bank account threshold at $10,000 and providing an exemption for wage earners like teachers and firefighters,\" Yellen said.\n\nThe fact sheet says, \"Imagine a taxpayer who reports $10,000 of income; but has $10 million of flows in and out of their bank account. Having this summary information will help flag for the IRS when high-income people under-report their income (and under-pay their tax obligations). This will help the IRS target its enforcement activities on those who are actually evading their tax obligations‚Äîdecreasing costly and burdensome audits for the vast majority of taxpayers who pay what they owe.\"\n\nThe proposal is a long way from being enacted. Its currently included in a multi-trillion dollar social spending package lawmakers and the White House have been negotiating for months. If that package is passed and signed into law, the requirement wouldnt begin until December 2022.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden D-Ore., who spearheaded the effort to revise the proposal, dispute Republican claims that the goal is to snoop on Americans financial transactions.\n\n\"The bottom line is, wealthy tax cheats are ripping off the American people to the tune of billions and billions of dollars per year. Tax cheats thrive when the reporting rules that apply to them are loose and murky. Democrats want to fix this broken approach and crack down on the cheating at the top,\" Wyden said in a press conference on the announcement Tuesday.\n\nWyden made clear that even Americans who might make a large purchase over $10,000 wouldnt be subject to the additional reporting.\n\n\"If you don‚Äôt have $10,000 above your paycheck, Social Security income, or the like coming in or going out, there‚Äôs no additional reporting. We‚Äôve also addressed the scenario where an individual spends a significant amount of savings for a major purchase. There will be no additional reporting in this scenario, as long as the amount of money coming into the account does not exceed wages +$10,000,\" Wyden said. Bloomberg via Getty Images The Internal Revenue Service building in Washington, D.C., on June 26, 2021.\n\nThe administration did not specify if the changes will impact the additional tax revenue they might be able to collect through enforcement. The administration has estimated improved tax enforcement could net up to $600 billion in additional tax revenue over the next decade.\n\nThe initial proposal, which would have affected nearly every non-dormant bank account in the U.S., raised the ire of Republican lawmakers, who called it a breach of privacy and an example of government overreach. Even with the revisions to the proposal, Republicans in the Senate remained critical.\n\n\"So how long is it gonna take for them to say, Well you know we need a little bit more information because we really cant make much of this. Then theyre going to want individual transactions and who knows what,\" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters.\n\nSen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, cited President Bidens commitment not to raise taxes on any American making less than $400,000, suggesting that threshold ought to be applied to IRS reporting.\n\n‚ÄúWhy dont they just put a ban in there that bans the IRS from snooping in the accounts of people who make less than $400,000?  Thats the question I think that should be asked with the sponsors of this approach,\" Crapo said.\n\nCrapo was hard-pressed to give an example of an alternative way to close the tax gap other than to say mention ‚Äúclosing loopholes.‚Äù\n\nBanking industry representatives remain skeptical of any additional reporting requirement, saying it will create a burden, especially for smaller community banks.Comments (0 )Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email this article ABC News Live\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events Copyright ¬© 2021 ABC News Internet Ventures.

To change your outgoing message, you have to CALL into your voicemail and then navigate the menus, record a new greeting, confirm the new greeting, etc. YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITH NO SIGNAL.\"\n\n\"If your battery is low, do not waste power by calling your voicemail ‚Äî or a friend or relative,\" the search and rescue group¬†wrote. \"Call 9-1-1 for help.\"\n\n\"If you have no signal, text for help to 9-1-1,\" Alpine Search and Rescue advised. \"Many, if not most, 9-1-1 centers can receive a text.\"\n\nLarimer County Search and Rescue added that you should be¬†as succinct as possible but make sure to include your name, information on injuries, location¬†and any other critical information. The shorter the message, the less data connection is needed for it to push through the cell network.\n\n\"Text takes much less power, is far more likely to get through, will automatically retry many times if you have spotty service, leaves a record others can see and can give you an indication that it got thru,\" Alpine Search and Rescue¬†said in its post. \"Because of the automatic retries, you can compose and hit send on a text and then get your phone as high as possible to improve the chances of getting the message out.\"\n\nDont change locations after calling for help, the search and rescue group said.

At least, that‚Äôs what a new paper by Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow says.\n\nThis morning, friend and fellow science writer  forwarded me an American Chemical Society press release titled ‚ÄúCould ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô dinosaurs rule other planets?‚Äù Since I was still a little bleary-eyed at the early hour, I thought I had read that wrong. But I saw it right the first time. ‚ÄúNew scientific research raises the possibility that advanced versions of T. rex and other dinosaurs‚Äîmonstrous creatures with the intelligence and cunning of humans‚Äîmay be the life forms that evolved on other planets in the universe,‚Äù the item explained.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if the pronouncement was inspired ‚Äîthe awful 1978 film about a futuristic space crew stranded on a planet stuck in the dinosaurian heyday of the Mesozoic. But the paper itself suggests a different origin for what is ultimately a fossil-based non sequitur.\n\nBreslow‚Äôs paper is primarily concerned with why the biochemical signature of life on earth is so consistent. Molecules such as amino acids, sugars, DNA and RNA exist in one of two possible orientations, left-handed or right-handed. Instead of showing a mixture of both forms, biomolecules typically come in only one form: Most sugars have a right-handed orientation, while most amino acids exhibit a left-handed orientation. Why life on earth should exhibit these particular arrangements and not the other possible orientations is a mystery that goes back to the origin of life itself.\n\nOne idea, favored by Breslow, is that meteorites carried specific types of amino acids and other organic flotsam to earth around 4 billion years ago. This is an extension of the idea that life here was ‚Äúseeded‚Äù by comets, asteroids or meteorites. The origin and subsequent evolution of our planet‚Äôs flora and fauna would be constrained by the characteristics of the biomolecules that gave life a jump-start.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with dinosaurs. (The first dinosaurs, as far as we know, originated a scant 230 million years ago.) Yet, in closing, Breslow briefly speculates on what alien creatures might look like‚Äîperhaps possessing the opposite biochemical orientations of life on earth. ‚ÄúSuch life forms could well be advanced versions of dinosaurs,‚Äù Breslow writes, ‚Äúif mammals did not have the good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision.‚Äù Whatever such space dinosaurs might look like, though, ‚ÄúWe would be better off not meeting them,‚Äù Breslow warns.\n\nAs much as I‚Äôm charmed by the idea of alien dinosaurs, Breslow‚Äôs conjecture makes my brain ache. Our planet‚Äôs fossil record has intricately detailed the fact that evolution is not a linear march of progress from one predestined waypoint to another. Dinosaurs were never destined to be. The history of life on earth has been greatly influenced by chance and contingency, and dinosaurs are a perfect example of this fact.\n\nPrior to 250 million years ago, the synapsids‚Äîour ancestors and relatives‚Äîwere the dominant creatures on land. But the apocalyptic extinction at the end of the Permian Period eliminated most synapsid lineages, in addition to many other forms of life. This clearing of the ecological slate is what allowed a different group of creatures to proliferate. Early archosaurs, or ‚Äúruling reptiles,‚Äù included the archaic forerunners of crocodiles, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, in addition to various groups now extinct, and these creatures dominated the Triassic.\n\nDespite what has been traditionally told, though, the dinosaurian branch of the greater archosaur family tree didn‚Äôt immediately out-compete its neighbors. Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus were not the Triassic terrors they were cast as during the mid-1990s. For the most part, Triassic dinosaurs were small, rare, marginal parts of the ecosystems they inhabited. It was only after another mass extinction at the end of the Triassic, around 200 million years ago, that the competitors of early dinosaurs were removed and the reign of the dinosaurs truly began. ‚Äúhere was nothing predestined or superior about dinosaurs when they first arose,‚Äù paleontologist Stephen Brusatte and colleagues wrote in a massive review of dinosaur origins, ‚Äúand without the contingency of various earth-history events during the early Mesozoic, the Age of Dinosaurs might have never happened.‚Äù\n\nEven if we ignore all the major evolutionary events prior to 250 million years ago, the fossil record demonstrates that the origin and rise of the dinosaurs were heavily influenced by two catastrophic extinction events. Had the Permian or Triassic extinctions not happened, there is no indication that dinosaurs would have evolved or come to rule the world‚Äîunforeseen events drastically shaped evolutionary history. Why on earth would we expect such patterns to be played out in just the right sequence on another planet? To say that there are dinosaurs on alien worlds presupposes that there is an irresistible direction that all life follows, and that dinosaurs are an inevitable actors in the drawn-out drama. .\n\nThe strange thing is that Breslow acknowledges the role of mass extinctions in evolutionary history. His speculative space dinosaurs are supposedly ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù creatures which were spared from oblivion. Other writers have toyed with this concept before, the most famous example being Dougal Dixon‚Äôs . Sadly, though, Breslow did not include any illustrations or offer specific details about the sort of uber-dinosaurs he has in mind.\n\nYet, what we know of the history of life on earth dispenses with the need to imagine such fantastic, alien creatures. Dinosaurs still exist‚Äîbirds are a surviving dinosaur lineage that has exploded into a beautifully array of disparate forms. And some birds, such as ravens, are quite intelligent, so we don‚Äôt have to wonder about what an especially smart dinosaur would have looked like. The reign of the dinosaurs may have ended 66 million years ago, but their 230-million-year-old legacy continues to this day. A simple shift in our understanding of dinosaur evolution has rescued the beloved creatures from extinction. I deeply doubt that there are dinosaurs in space, but I am glad that at least one variety of feathered dinosaur remains with us here.\n\nReferences:\n\nBreslow, R. (2012).

All to no avail. The hiker spent the night on the side of the mountain before finally reaching safety.\n\n\"One notable take-away is that the subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didnt recognize the number,\" the rescue unit said .   The hiker was lost on the tallest peak in the Rockies\n\nMount Elbert is the tallest peak in the Rocky Mountains with an elevation of 14,433 feet. Both of the trails leading to its summit are \"well trodden class one trails,\" the , meaning theyre not very technical and dont require special gear. But the South Elbert Trail that the hiker was on does have an elevation gain of about 4,800 feet, and the mountain is currently capped with snow.\n\nThe hiker set out at 9 a.m. on Oct. 18 on a route that normally takes  to complete, round-trip. A caller alerted search and rescue teams around 8 p.m., and a five-person team stayed in the field looking for the hiker until 3 a.m., when the team suspended the search.\n\nMore searchers hit the mountain the next morning, but then the hiker appeared, having finally made it back to their car. The hiker had gotten disoriented in an ordeal that lasted about 24 hours.   Rescuers hope the incident can be a teachable moment\n\nLake County Search and Rescue is using the incident as a teaching moment.\n\n\"If youre overdue according to your itinerary, and you start getting repeated calls from an unknown number, please answer the phone; it may be a SAR [search and rescue] team trying to confirm youre safe!\"\n\nIn its message about the lost-and-found adventurer, the search and rescue unit also urged hikers on the mountain to \"please remember that the trail is obscured by snow above treeline, and will be in that condition now through probably late June. Please dont count on following your ascent tracks to descend the mountain, as wind will often cover your tracks.\"\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the rescue team urged people to treat the hikers plight with respect.\n\n\"What seems like common sense in hindsight is not obvious to a subject in the moment when they are lost and panicking. In Colorado, most folks who spend time outdoors have a good understanding of the SAR infrastructure that is there to help them, but this is not the case nation-wide.\"                                                         Read &amp; Listen                                              Connect                                              About NPR                                              Get Involved                                                                      NPR thanks our sponsors\n\n                  ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-hiker-ignored-calls-rescuers/'),

(Courtesy Chris Kelley)\n\nWhen Rep. Ilhan Omar ignited steep controversy&nbsp;in March describing the&nbsp;September 11 attacks as ‚Äúsome people did something,‚Äù it was then that a longtime cop in her neighborhood decided he needed to do more than just bemoan what he perceived as a shocking trivialization of a terrorist attack that tore through the fabric of his beloved country.\n\nNow, Chris Kelley, who has collected eleven military medals as a 27-year veteran of the U.S. Army and Army Reserves and clocked more than 36,000 hours patrolling the Minnesota streets as a 20-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Force, has his sights set on knocking Omar from her seat representing Minnesota‚Äôs 5th Congressional District in 2020.\n\n‚ÄúSeptember 11 was a terrible loss of life, not just for police officers and firefighters and other first responders, but 3,000 people and non-combatants died, and to be dismissive of that was an outrage. I could sit and complain or I could do something about it,‚Äù Kelley, who is campaigning as an Independent, told Fox News. ‚ÄúAnd I believe I can be a positive voice in standing up for people in our country, and for our first responders and the people every day on the frontlines.‚Äù\n\nIn his view, current representative Omar has devoted too much time to crafting her ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù than on being of service to the community, which he insists he will serve honorably&nbsp;if elected.\n\n‚ÄúAs former military, I am here to serve and not further my status. I want to do a good job for the people I represent and I don‚Äôt have a personal agenda,‚Äù noted Kelley, who deployed once during Operation Desert Storm and twice during Operation Iraqi Freedom as an intelligence analyst and also holds an masters degree in Criminal Justice Leadership from Concordia University in St. Paul. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm passionate about service and I just want to be able to continue that.‚Äù  \n\n       Kelley deployed once during Operation Desert Storm and twice during Operation Iraqi Freedom as an intelligence analyst.

Kelley campaigned for the Republican Senate endorsement in 2016 and, while unsuccessful, it gave the 49-year-old a taste for what Minnesotans wanted and needed.\n\n‚ÄúImmigration is a big issue right now. I believe in having a secure border; if you don‚Äôt have a country you don‚Äôt have a border and our border agents are doing a great job, but they are being overwhelmed and Congress isn‚Äôt giving them the tools they need,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I would also like to see a pathway to citizenship for those under DACA; they couldn‚Äôt help they were brought here and need a shot to be able to stay here.‚Äù\n\nKelley stressed that he also remains firmly committed to boosting Medicare, while ensuring private health insurance remains available and the costs are driven down.&nbsp;He also supports term limits on representatives of both the House and the Senate.  \n\n       U.S. Rep.

By   Stacy Schiff      October 28, 2016   Historical truths emerge only with time, after which they are ours, particularly on Halloween, to mangle. Early on, the Salem witch trials disappeared from the record; a hush descended over 1692 for generations. ‚ÄúThe People of Salem Do Not Like to Be Questioned in Regard to the Witchery Affair‚Äù reads a Philadelphia Inquirer headline ‚Äî from 1895. It fell to others to resurrect the ‚Äúwitchcraft,‚Äù as the South did during the debate over slavery. Then came Arthur Miller, who made off with the story, or at least a version of it. A lush mythology grew up around the trials, one that reassured us that these events took place in a remote land in no way resembling our own. In truth, they are deeply woven into the American fabric. They are more relevant than the lore suggests ‚Äî our earliest instance of conspiratorial fantasy and reckless demonizing, of the brand of national distemper that grips us in anxious times.  Myth No. 1 The convicted witcheswere burned.\n\nDespite numerous , the idea that Salem‚Äôs ‚Äúwitches‚Äù burned at the stake persists everywhere from   to  of ‚ÄúThe Simpsons.‚Äù Joan of Arc and tales of European witch hunts may flicker too brightly in our minds. Generally, French witches burned, while English witches hanged. (This posed a conundrum to the Channel island of Guernsey when three witches turned up there in 1617. The malefactors were hanged, then burned.)\n\nThe American South reinforced the burning-at-the-stake fiction in the 19th century. ‚ÄúThe North .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. having begun with burning witches, will end by burning us!‚Äù screeched a popular magazine in 1860, after Lincoln‚Äôs election.\n\nWith one exception, however, all who went to their deaths in Salem hanged. (Giles Corey, an elderly Salem farmer, was crushed under stones for several days after refusing to plead guilty or innocent. He remains the only individual in American history to be pressed to death.) No one burned.     The Gallows Hill Project pinpointed the exact site of the infamous Salem witch hangings, which killed 19 people in 1692. The team identified Proctors Ledge, not Gallows Hill, as the spot of the executions. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)    Myth No. 2 The victims were all women.\n\nEvery October, Halloween confirms what we learned from ‚Äú‚Äù: Witches are women. Pop-culture depictions of the trials, such as the show ‚Äú,‚Äù focus  on the female accused.\n\nIndeed, misogyny powered the European witch hunts of the 15th and 16th centuries, but Salem was different. Of the 19 who hanged in Salem, four were men, including a feckless, fortune-telling carpenter and a 42-year-old Harvard-educated minister. Accused witches came in every variety, from the richest of Salem merchants to the dutiful wife of a blind farmer. The terror was all the greater for its very arbitrariness; no one, noted a letter to authorities from a group of men late in the summer, had cause to think himself safe. The youngest accused witch was a 5-year-old girl. Having spent most of 1692 in miniature manacles, she wound up insane.\n\nGender did play a vital role in the hysteria. Women would not incriminate husbands, while a number of men eagerly informed the court that they had long suspected their wives to be witches. Family fingers pointed in all directions, although no son ever accused a father, or father a son. The wizards, however, attracted more attention in contemporary accounts, both for their supernatural powers and for their dignity en route to the gallows. Even skeptics assumed the worst of the Harvard-educated minister. From the start, he was thought to have been the diabolical mastermind, a role for which no woman, however nefarious, seemed qualified. Myth No. 3 The panic took place in Salem.\n\nIndeed, it began in Salem village, today Danvers, Mass., where two little girls convulsed. And indeed, the accused stood trial in the town of Salem. But witches turned up across the Massachusetts Bay Colony, ultimately in 24 communities.\n\nOne of the Salem girls named a total of 62 names; the bewitched denounced people in other towns who did not even know of their existence. They seemed to enjoy visionary powers. At his arraignment, a bluff Boston sea captain, a son of Plymouth‚Äôs founding family who was accused by someone in Salem, challenged the logic: Why would he bother to enchant people he neither knew of nor had ever met? Though he had done business with, sailed with and prayed with several members of the witchcraft court, they had no patience for his query. He went to jail.\n\nSalem remained the epicenter of the crisis, but Andover, Mass., about 15 miles away, would be most severely affected. Nearly 1 in 10 of its residents were accused of witchcraft, often by their own family members, many of whom themselves confessed to having signed satanic pacts and flown over the treetops to a diabolical meeting. Andover‚Äôs senior minister discovered that he was related to no fewer than 22 witches.  Myth No. 4 Superstition was the driving force.\n\nAs a Philadelphia reporter put it in 1895, ‚Äúblind, senseless superstition‚Äù accounted for the trials, an idea that persists to this day.\n\nIn fact, piety played a greater role in Salem than superstition. The idea of witches came straight from  ; those who knew their Bible best believed most fervently in witchcraft. Not coincidentally, it tended to turn up in more pious homes.\n\nThe best minds in New England interpreted and adjudicated the epidemic. Those ministers and civic authorities pondered the cases scientifically. They read and reread the witchcraft literature, to which several of them had contributed. They parsed legal code. They knew their history. They worked in the sterling name of reason. The trouble was that the most literate in 1692 also happened to be the most literal. They were not so much out of their depth as they were swimming in information ‚Äî ‚Äúpoisoned,‚Äù one critic later , ‚Äúin their education.‚Äù\n\nThe Bay Colony may have qualified as the best-educated community in the history of the world in 1692. Piety correlated with literacy; rarely had so many been able to read. The majority of the adolescent girls in Salem village could read, even if they could not sign their names. Erudition and piety played greater roles in the crisis than did ignorance and superstition. Myth No. 5 Ergot poisoning was to blame for the witch trials.\n\nBehavioral scientist Linnda Caporael proposed this elegant theory in 1976: A contaminated rye supply introduced ergot poisoning to Salem, causing convulsions and hallucinations in the accusing girls. Debunked,  and , Caporael‚Äôs theory nevertheless continues to pop up in  about Salem and in footnotes in  about psychedelic drugs. And for good reason. If we could blame the rye, we could exonerate nearly everyone else. We would finally have a diagnosis for what might have caused a Salem girl to complain of prickling skin, to fling herself across a room, crash to the floor, fall into a trance ‚Äî and report that she could see a fellow parishioner perching in the church beams above the congregation‚Äôs heads.\n\nSome of the 17th-century symptoms do appear consistent with ergot poisoning. But the hallucinating girls shared meals with non-hallucinating adults and siblings. The girls were often symptom-free, lucid and robust. Their health did not deteriorate. And in the absence of any such convulsions, plenty of grown men reported winged beasts in the fields and goblins in their parlors. The bewitched girls also vouched for a coordinated set of hallucinations, which speaks to an unusual form of imagination. Nor does ergot explain the girls‚Äô sermon-interrupting or their inability to pray. In an earlier case, a bewitched girl could read without trouble but seized up when handed a religious text. Ergot poisoning, or St. Anthony‚Äôs fire, was moreover not unknown at the time.\n\nThe tenacity of the theory makes sense. Unresolved mysteries annoy us. When it comes to assigning blame, none of us draws a blank. If we could write the whole crisis down to ergot, we would at long last have a simple explanation for a host of oddities. We would also fall prey to the same kind of thinking that led a 17th-century New Englander ‚Äî equally perplexed, equally intent on a tidy answer ‚Äî to write ambulatory trees and flying neighbors down to witchcraft.\n\n Twitter: @stacyschiff\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

Picture taken November 23, 2019.  REUTERS/Angus Mordant//File PhotoOct 6 (Reuters) - Volatility in U.S. natural gas futures jumped to a record on Tuesday on the back of an energy crunch in major world markets that has sent prices soaring globally.\n\nNatural gas prices are at record levels in Europe and Asia, as major markets like China struggle to find enough fuel to meet demand that has bounced back from the coronavirus-induced downturn faster than anticipated.\n\nIn Europe, prices this year have rocketed more than 500%, on worries that current low levels of storage will be insufficient for the winter.\n\nThat has fed through to U.S. natural gas futures, which recently closed at 12-year-highs of $6.31 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).\n\nWhile that is still a far cry from prices in Europe and Asia where natural gas is over five times more expensive, the market has grown increasingly volatile as competition for limited U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports increases.\n\nIn the United States, implied volatility - a measure of expected fluctuations in the market - surged to an all-time high of 122.5% on Tuesday, topping the prior record of 117.5% reached in November 2018.\n\nPart of the reason for the wild moves is merchant commodity firms, hedge funds and other major investors in the market finding themselves exposed to unexpected price rallies. Companies that bet the wrong direction on markets are sometimes forced to shift positions quickly to cover their losses, further adding to the volatility.\n\nThere have been no recent reports of hedge funds failing, but Statar, which invests in gas, reportedly lost about $130 million. By contrast, commodities giant Andurand has posted big returns due to rising prices. The natural gas market is experiencing a series of wild swings as power crunches in Asia and Europe spur panicked buying to secure supply.\n\nCompetition between Europe and Asia for limited LNG cargoes and other energy supplies has led to manufacturers curtailing activity in Europe and sparked power crises in China. Global gas prices have spiked to record highs of around $40 per mmBtu in Europe and $35 in Asia .\n\nThe last time volatility spiked so aggressively in November 2018, volume in gas traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) soared to a record 1.6 million contracts.\n\nOn Tuesday, volume on the NYMEX held around 500,000 contracts, a little higher than over the past 30 days but only the most in a day since last week.\n\nHowever, volumes in the U.S. Natural Gas Fund , an exchange-traded fund designed to track gas prices, soared over 30.2 million shares on Sept. 28, its biggest daily volume since hitting a record 43.1 million shares in November 2018.\n\nAnalysts do not expect U.S. prices to reach the lofty levels in Europe or Asia because the United States should have enough gas in storage for the winter heating season and because U.S. LNG export plants were already producing all of the super-cooled gas they can.\n\nThe United States only has the capacity to turn about 10.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas into LNG, or about 13% of what the nation consumes domestically.\n\nGlobal markets will have to wait until later this year to get more from the United States when the sixth liquefaction train at Cheniere Energy Inc&#x27;s  Sabine Pass and Venture Global LNG&#x27;s Calcasieu Pass in Louisiana are expected to start producing LNG in test mode.

A Florida child fatally overdosed. In communities around the country, such headlines¬†are stoking fears that a momentary brush with a tiny amount of fentanyl powder could prove fatal.\n\nThe , blamed for increasing numbers of overdose deaths across the U.S., is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. But experts consulted by STAT said many of the reported incidents¬†appear to be false alarms that run counter to scientific fact and exaggerate the risks.\n\nThe American College of Medical Toxicology recently issued a position¬†¬†concluding that, based on what‚Äôs been publicly released, none of the recent incidents involving first responders is consistent with opioid toxicity. The¬†doctors, who reviewed a handful of cases, said they are not challenging the truthfulness of the officers involved. Rather, they are questioning whether their reports are verified cases of poisonings that carry the hallmarks of opioid exposure.\n\nadvertisement\n\n‚ÄúA lot of the symptoms are nondescript, such as vague dizziness, that don‚Äôt concern opioid poisoning,‚Äù said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and lead author of the paper. ‚ÄúAnd in a lot of the cases, the way that they were exposed doesn‚Äôt make sense, like brushing a small amount of powder off a uniform.‚Äù\n\nWhile most of the reports have involved first responders, some have involved young children, including the fatal overdose of a  who was found to have a mixture of heroin and fentanyl in his body. How he came in contact with opioids remains unknown, although authorities have raised the possibility that he encountered it at a community pool or walking through a neighborhood known to be a hotbed of opioid trafficking.\n\nadvertisement\n\nEstablishing the truth in these cases is not just a matter of setting the record straight, but of preventing hysteria and ensuring public safety. While accidental exposure to opioids can take lives, so can undue fear of the risks. For first responders, taking extra precautions¬†could delay lifesaving care for people suffering overdoses and distract from more pressing threats, such as a suspect at a crime scene.\n\n‚ÄúWe want to prevent unintended consequences,‚Äù said Dr. Diane Calello, medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System. ‚ÄúIf a law enforcement professional is wearing a lot of unnecessary protective gear in a situation that requires an agile response, that in and of itself is a safety issue.‚Äù\n\nConversely, failing to take proper precautions could also result in harm. So what‚Äôs the right balance?\n\nSTAT spoke to several toxicologists and law enforcement officials to examine the underlying science of fentanyl exposure and the extent of the risk it poses to first responders and the public.\n\nIn several incidents, officers have reportedly fallen ill after a powdered form of fentanyl came in contact with their .\n\nAlthough  can be fatal, several toxicologists said contact with intact skin is extremely unlikely to cause opioid toxicity, which can occur only if the substance enters the bloodstream.\n\n‚ÄúIf you have fentanyl powder on your hand for five or 10 minutes, it‚Äôs inconceivable that that would be sufficient to cause you to have an overdose,‚Äù said Dr. David Juurlink, a toxicologist at the University of Toronto.\n\nFentanyl cannot penetrate the skin on its own. It needs moisture. That‚Äôs why, in clinical care, patients are given fentanyl patches to aid in absorption and relieve pain. The position paper by the American College of Medical Toxicology reported that, even if a large area of the body were covered with fentanyl patches, it would take 14 minutes to transmit a therapeutic dose of 100 micrograms, let alone an overdose.\n\n‚ÄúFor the fentanyl patch to work, you have to put a lot of fentanyl in the patch. It has to be moist and it has to be in contact with the skin for a long period of time, in a special liquid,‚Äù said Stolbach. ‚ÄúThose aren‚Äôt the conditions that are going to occur when somebody is incidentally exposed.‚Äù\n\nOne of the most widely reported incidental overdoses occurred in , where officer Chris Green became ill following a traffic stop involving drugs. Green has recovered and returned to work.\n\nThe city‚Äôs police chief, John Lane, said he believes Green‚Äôs illness resulted from opioid exposure, regardless of the¬† by toxicologists. Lane said a screening test confirmed that Green had opioids in his body, but the exact method of exposure remains unclear.\n\nHe said Green collapsed moments after he brushed a small amount of powder off his shirt at the police station, after the traffic stop was over.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if he brushed it off with his hand or rubbed his eye,‚Äù Lane said. ‚ÄúWe think what may have happened is that he put on that Purel or Germ-X stuff, and that got it wet and maybe he absorbed it¬†that way. We‚Äôre not sure. All we know is he overdosed from it.‚Äù\n\nThe medical toxicologists group specifically warns that alcohol-based hand sanitizers should never be used, because they are ineffective in removing fentanyl and may increase drug absorption. The organization said officers should take basic precautions to prevent the remote risk of poisoning through skin contact, such as wearing nitrile gloves and immediately washing with copious amounts of water if contact does occur. 		           \n\nA roundup of STATs top stories of the day.                              Please enter a valid email address.                                                     Leave this field empty if youre human:\n\nToxicologists said the possibility of accidental¬†inhalation presents a higher risk, especially in poorly ventilated spaces where public safety officials suspect fentanyl is dispersed in the air.\n\nCalello said inhaling fentanyl ‚Äî or ingesting it ‚Äî puts it in contact with mucous membranes in the nose or mouth, providing the drug a way into the bloodstream,¬†which can result in poisoning.\n\nShe added, however, that such circumstances are unlikely to arise during a traffic stop or in other open-air environments. ‚ÄúHandling an overdose victim is not going to entail a plume of aerosolized drug,‚Äù Calello said.\n\nIt would take prolonged exposure to a large amount of airborne fentanyl to cause an overdose, according to the medical toxicologists. Their report references safety standards for industrial workers who manufacture fentanyl. ‚ÄúAt the highest airborne concentration encountered by workers, an unprotected individual would require nearly 200 minutes of exposure to reach a dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl,‚Äù the report states. (100 mcg, or micrograms, is enough to have a therapeutic effect but not enough to cause an overdose.)\n\n‚ÄúWe would expect in an industrial fentanyl production plant there‚Äôs going to be more fentanyl in the air than there would be at any crime scene,‚Äù Hopkins‚Äôs Stolbach said.\n\nStill, in cases where first responders suspect a high concentration of airborne opioids, the medical toxicologists group recommends that officers use a respirator, in addition to wearing water-resistant coveralls to block skin exposure.\n\nToxicologists said officers may indeed be getting sick following exposure to fentanyl or other substances, but that does not necessarily mean the drugs are the cause.\n\nThe only way to confirm a case of poisoning is to conduct a urine or blood¬†test, or to verify that symptoms were reversed by a dose of naloxone. But such evidence is lacking in many of the cases reported around the country.\n\n‚ÄúThe common theme is that there is no biochemical confirmation,‚Äù Stolbach said. In most cases, the media is reporting that officers are being hospitalized, but hospitalization may just be a precaution.\n\nJuurlink said the real culprit in these cases may be a phenomenon known as the , in which the mere suggestion that a substance can be harmful causes people to suffer negative effects after exposure. In medical research, for example, being informed of side effects related to a pill or procedure can bring on real-life symptoms.\n\n‚ÄúIf in a moment of panic, a person sees powder on their skin and they‚Äôve read reports on the internet about people having overdosed, you could see how that might cause someone to at least believe they‚Äôve had an overdose,‚Äù Juurlink said.\n\nIndeed, some of the symptoms reportedly suffered by public safety officers, such as a , , and anxiety, are more consistent with panic than opioid poisoning. ‚ÄúIf anything, people with opioid poisoning would have a slow heart rate,‚Äù Stolbach said.\n\nToxicologists said law enforcement officials should be trained to recognize the objective symptoms of opioid poisoning so they can deliver the opioid antidote naloxone when appropriate. Those symptoms would take hold within a few minutes of exposure. A person would become sleepy and lethargic and start¬†breathing at an abnormally slow rate.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the typical progression,‚Äù Calello said. ‚ÄúFrom awake to sleepy, to asleep, to unconscious. The things that have been described in the news really are not what we typically see with patients who get opioids.‚Äù 					 					 				 									 													 			 			National Technology Correspondent\n\nCasey covers the use of artificial intelligence in medicine and its underlying questions of safety, fairness, and privacy.

Some optimists may even take heart in the fact that  in September for only the second time in 17 months but that is a misleading statistic. Immigration experts have  by showing that encounters with border crossers are down because more border agents are being pulled off the line to deal with the crush of migrants in other areas, which results in a spike of ‚Äúgotaways,‚Äù or those who enter the U.S. and are not apprehended.&nbsp;\n\nRight now, a massive migrant caravan is moving through Central America and preparing to come to the U.S. One of the leaders of the caravan is  the U.S., declaring that the migrants are ‚Äúready for war‚Äù if their demands are not met. The Biden administration  to this threat by ignoring it, and  in the corporate media are doing the same.&nbsp;      &nbsp;|&nbsp;\n\nJust because the Biden White House and the media are ignoring the caravan, however, does not mean that all is well. &nbsp;The caravan, which was organized by allowing participants to register via QR code, is reportedly bringing over 3,000 migrants to the border. There have also been reports of tens of thousands of migrants gathering near the border,  the U.S. If so, this looming invasion has the potential to make the Haitian migrant surge of September look minor by comparison. Joe Biden, meanwhile, is doubling down on his anti-borders agenda.\n\nDuring a recent CNN town hall, Biden  should visit the southern border, but suggested that he was too busy to do so. Meanwhile, the Biden administration continues to pursue its ‚Äúroot causes‚Äù strategy, which focuses on rooting out crime and poverty in Central America in order to encourage potential migrants to stay in their home countries.&nbsp;\n\n is neither serious nor realistic, as it provides zero relief to Americans suffering from the border crisis right now. No one should be surprised, as the impact of these policies on the American people does not seem to be a concern to this White House.&nbsp;\n\n‚ÄúThe root cause is in the Oval Office,‚Äù former acting ICE Director and Immigration Reform Law Institute Senior Fellow Tom Homan  in a recent interview. ‚ÄúThe promises he made, the executive orders he‚Äôs signed. Getting rid of all the programs that worked in the Trump administration, that‚Äôs the cause.‚Äù\n\nThe Biden administration has abandoned nearly every Trump administration program that had successfully stemmed the flow of migration to the U.S. From attempting to terminate the Remain-in-Mexico policy, to bringing back catch-and-release, to halting construction of the border wall, the Biden administration has done almost everything possible to encourage large-scale, illegal migration into the U.S. The American people have suffered immensely as a result of these policies, and not just Americans who live near the border.\n\nThe U.S. is in the midst of a massive opioid crisis that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Biden‚Äôs disastrous immigration policies. More than 90,000 Americans  of drug overdoses last year, a roughly 30 percent increase from the previous year. The states West Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio, far from the southern border. Given that the vast majority of , a particularly deadly opioid, comes to the U.S. through the southern border, it is reasonable to assume that many of these deaths would be preventable if our politicians would simply take border security seriously.&nbsp;     Recommended   Matt Vespa\n\nUnfortunately, the looming invasion threatens to make this crisis even worse, and lead to more preventable deaths among young people. Earlier this month, the Texas Department of Public Safety $23 million of fentanyl, enough to kill roughly 90 million Americans. In addition to the drugs pouring in,  at the border also remains high.\n\nJoe Biden could stop the carnage at the border any time he wants. All he has to do is reinstate and enforce the policies that worked so well during the last administration. Unfortunately, it appears Biden is content to sit on his hands and do nothing, and America and its citizens will suffer as a result.\n\nDale L.

Sharing the clip, she urged people to pay close attention to her black dog.\n\n‚ÄúSorry for the obnoxious barking at the beginning. Watch my black dog. [A] ghost takes her collar off in her crate,‚Äù she wrote in the video‚Äôs caption.\n\nIn the video, you see the two dogs, who are in separate crates barking at each other in what appears to be a living room.Recommended\n\nBoth dogs bark profusely until around the 23-second mark in the video when the pups ceased all noise, standing alert for a moment.\n\nThe black dog, who is in the crate to the right begins to whimper and then suddenly jumps back into a corner of the crate, seemingly trying to avoid something once its collar randomly pops off.\n\n¬†to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter\n\nIt was at this moment that the owner was certain that a ‚Äòghost‚Äô was responsible‚Äîand others agreed.\n\nSince the video was posted, it accrued over 1.3 million views at the time of writing and over 43,600 comments from people who think it‚Äôs a ghost as well.\n\n‚ÄúThey both got super quiet...they felt the energy,‚Äù someone wrote.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen such a convincing ghost video,‚Äù another added while a third noted that a seeming entity messing with dogs ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt sit right‚Äù with them.\n\nOn the other hand, others believed there were logical explanations as to why the collar magically came off, with some saying that it was ‚Äústiff fabric‚Äù that caused the collar to unclasp or it simply ‚Äúcame off by accident and the dog got scared.‚Äù\n\nNo matter what transpired, it‚Äôs safe to say that the case of the fallen collar appeared to be creepy nonetheless.More About:

There are now , many of them among people who are unvaccinated.\n\nWe asked advertising and marketing executives to share how they would choose to market vaccines, if the struggling medicines were their client.\n\n1. Market them to kids. There&#8217;s a reason Saturday morning ads are all about food, toys and games. Getting kids to ask their parents for a product&mdash;a strategy called &#8220;pester power&#8221;&mdash;works. And it could work for vaccines too, says Bill Wright, global executive creative director for McCann Worldgroup (the firm behind ads for Verizon FiOS, General Mills and Mucinex).\n\nWright suggests an ad that says to kids: &ldquo;Get vaccinated and you won&rsquo;t get measles. Measles are horrible and hurt. And by the way, when you get a shot it&rsquo;s customary to eat ice cream and get a small toy.&#8221;\n\n2. Make it funny. Imagine an ad with a celebrity cage fight: on one side, anti-vaxxer Jenny McCarthy, and on the other, pro-vaccine Amanda Peet. That&#8217;s the advertising fantasy of Robin Fitzgerald, VP/creative director at CP+B LA, the firm behind ads for Netflix and Burger King. &#8220;We have it at Caesar&#8217;s Palace and Hillary Clinton and Bill O&#8217;Reilly are in front row seats cheering on Peet,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Just so people really feel the hyperbolic ridiculousness and the level the debate has gone to.&#8221;\n\nAlternatively, Fitzgerald sees a sequel to the film Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, who&#8217;s expressed . This time, it&#8217;s called Still Clueless and Paul Rudd keeps canceling playdates with Silverstone&#8217;s kids over vaccines.\n\nHumor is the way to go, agreed folks at The Martin Agency, the company behind the GEICO ads. &#8220;A campaign using humor makes the situation much more approachable,&#8221; says CCO Joe Alexander. Funny ads appeal to millennials, Alexander says, which is an age demographic more likely to think parents  when it comes to vaccinating their kids.\n\nOne of the most successful campaigns to try this approach was &#8220;Dumb Ways to Die,&#8221; by Metro Trains in Melbourne, Australia. In the video (below), animated characters die in &#8220;dumb&#8221; ways like lighting themselves on fire and poking a grizzly bear with a stick. The goal was to promote train safety, and the campaign went viral. Alexander says the same approach could be used for measles.\n\n3. Try sarcasm. Imagine a somber ad thanking anti-vaxxers for the measles outbreak. Wright says a message like this could work: &#8220;We would like to thank you for bringing back archaic diseases like measles, mumps and whooping cough. Yay, it&rsquo;s like 1800 all over again, way to go!&rdquo;\n\n4. Get personal. We need stories that combat the narrative from loud voices like Jenny McCarthy, says Elizabeth Cleveland, vice president/planning director of The Martin Agency. But instead of hearing from doctors, she says, moms with kids who contracted measles should have the voice. Cleveland asked her own pediatrician for some stories, who supplied the perfect one-liner from a mom: &#8220;If my son can&#8217;t bring a peanut butter sandwich to school, then you can&#8217;t bring your unvaccinated child.&rdquo;\n\n5. Talk about measles, not vaccines. Go after the disease itself, rather than the vaccine debate, says Pete Harvey, creative director/partner at advertising agency . (Harvey worked previously on highly successful &#8220;&#8221; campaign against tobacco.) His idea? An ad with one simple message: &#8220;The measles are back.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;That way, there is a common enemy that isn&rsquo;t the person you are trying to convince,&#8221; says Harvey. &#8220;Everyone will say we have to fight this&mdash;no parent would say no to that.&#8221;\n\n6. Launch a social media campaign. Find a way for everyone who gets vaccines to raise their hand and say so. Wright suggests creating a shareable graphic on Twitter and Facebook that says: &#8220;I got my kids vaccinated, did you?&#8221;\n\nThe idea is similar to the  that got millions to change their profile pictures to a red equal sign for same sex marriage (see below). &#8220;It needs to be a coordinated effort, not a series of biting tweets,&#8221; says Patrick Godfrey, managing partner and president of the firm Godfrey Q. &#8220;Move [the anti-vaxxers] into a corner.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Human Rights Campaign\n\n7. Add a little fear. Create a film chronicling the measles outbreak, suggests Fitzgerald, who notes that she&#8217;d recruit Danny Boyle, the director behind the post-apocalyptic film 28 Days Later. &#8220;We open in Disneyland, we see someone cough, and it takes off from there,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We market the movie by having big groups of red dotted men, women and children appear flash-mob style in public places dancing to Desmond Dekker&#8217;s You Can Get it If You Really Want.&#8221;\n\n8. Make it a game. Create an app calculating your risk of getting measles, similar to the app &#8220;&#8221; which determines the chance that your plane is going to crash, suggests Tiffany Coletti Titolo, president of cummins &amp; partners, the firm behind Jeep ads. Parents would input demographic data and get stats about the likelihood of getting measles, plus the unlikelihood that someone has an adverse event from the vaccine. For example, you&#8217;re 100 times  to be struck by lightning than to have a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine.\n\n9. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t preach. The Internet has chastised anti-vaxxers, but simply yelling at them isn&#8217;t going to change a parent&#8217;s mind. In highly emotional debates, some people get very stuck in their ways&mdash;but it&#8217;s not impossible to change their minds, says Wright, who also worked on the &#8220;Truth&#8221; campaign against tobacco. &#8220;Before, anti-tobacco was very preachy&mdash;we just wanted to present the facts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We found that the fact that resonated the most [with teens] was that Big Tobacco was just another preachy adult telling them what to do.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;It&rsquo;s all about parents wanting to feel like they have a say in the matter,&#8221; Harvey agrees. &#8220;If you say they shouldn&rsquo;t, they dig their heels further.&#8221;                                                                      More Must-Read Stories From TIME\n\nContact us at .

The event will be moderated by Trump 2020 National Press Secretary Hogan Gidley at 1 p.m. on Monday.\n\n‚ÄúI am excited to be back in North Carolina, and speaking with members of the community about how President Trump has delivered for hardworking American families. President Trump has kept his promises and increased funding for our tremendous military, fostered peace in the Middle East, and is bringing home our troops, cut taxes for hardworking families, and delivered USMCA for American workers and farmers. He will continue to fight for North Carolinians for the next four years!‚Äù Ivanka Trump said in a press release.\n\nThe event comes just two weeks after¬†President Trump was in Wilmington to declare the city a WWII Heritage City.\n\nThis visit marks Ivanka‚Äôs fifth time in North Carolina in the last 3 ¬Ω years. Her most recent visit was on Thursday in Raleigh, where, in her official capacity, she toured a local farmers market with Secretary Sonny Perdue to highlight the Farmers to Families Food Box program.\n\nThat effort has delivered over 100 million meals to Americans in-need in response to COVID-19, according to a statement from the Trump Campaign.\n\nLATEST HEADLINES:\n\n         September 13, 2020                    Share                     Related Articles      26 mins ago      2 hours ago      4 hours ago      5 hours ago      6 hours ago      23 hours ago           Advertisement Recent Posts Advertisement           Most Viewed Posts    Last Modified Posts                              \n\n,¬†,¬†,¬†,¬†      Recent Posts                                                             &copy; Copyright 2021, All Rights Reserved                           Search for:         Categories                                   ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eric-trump-holding-shovel-backwards/');

Slouching naked apes thumb jabbing their hand held thingies and drooling over their idiot gizmos are no longer fully human, rather mindless mutton-headed interfaces with nobody home, or seldom available as they spend their pathetic half-lives peering down the black hole of their tacky, third rate NWO Chinese junk shop virtual ‚Äúreality‚Äù. It‚Äôs like listening to East Germans, that were surveilled by STASI psychopaths 24/7 before the Wall was moved, explaining how free they became (at least until 2 years back) even as they exhibit the same nauseating ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone ticks and prosthetic brain addictions as their thoroughly brainwashed cousins in the West while they themselves, without question, pay through the nose for this constant monitoring of their lives and interference from goons and &#8220;nudging&#8221; by the psychopaths that own the so-called &#8220;social media platforms&#8221; of Fecesbook, Twatter, EweTueb, Goggle and ilk&#8230;&#8221;safe&#8221; spaces where the sheeple bleat.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Though the STASI orphans should have known better, they too have already been consumed whole by trans humanist Mickey Mouse BS so the logical next step for the reptilians in charge is to pump their graphene oxide and nano dirt directly to their ovine brains and put them under complete remote control where monkey man never again has to miss a Twatter outburst or a Goggle command or Fecesbook &#8220;breaking news&#8221; fart or whatever crap they get from their blinking, prosthetic, vital organ when they deep dive into their amoled glass swamp.

If you can‚Äôt do something that simple yourself, as one who claims to ‚Äúget it‚Äù, then why should you expect the herd not to willfully poison itself considering they are no longer in control of anything in their miserable existences other than shoving stuff in their facial orifice or squeezing shit out their sphincter end as the case may be, in between perusing their &#8220;smart&#8221; phone smut and kitty litter videos, as they proudly and dutifully exhibit their covaids death squirt status Qr code to every jackbooted robopig thug that demands compliance as they go about their shameful and soon to be terminated lives&#8230;all in the prurient interest of course of the demons that unleashed this genocide and &#8220;watched over by machines of love and grace&#8221;. When the 5G towers and soon the 6G towers light up in the coming Dark Winter then the real electronic gulag will become apparent to even the most challenged leg of mutton out there in the pathetic human herd.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Never let any psychopath in your pocket or your life that is obviously &#8220;smarter&#8221; than you.\r\n &nbsp;\r\n &nbsp;\r\n ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù phone macht dumb\r\n But PfiZer macht frei &#8230;. permanently\r\n &nbsp;\r\n Same as it ever waZ\r\n &nbsp;       4       Reply             SJ Sherbs    20 days ago                Reply to&nbsp;   \n\nOmmm&#8230;.

They misleadingly imply the cargo backup is part of a plan to create shortages and later inflate fourth-quarter data to take credit for a strengthening economy.  ¬†                Container ships are anchored by the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles as they wait to offload on Sept. 20. Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nOne¬†  says the Biden administration is ‚Äúorchestrating‚Äù product shortages by denying foreign ships‚Äô entry into ports around the U.S. Comments on the post picked up on that unfounded claim, sensing a coordinated plan behind a map of offshore ships. ‚Äú Welcome. To. Communist. America.¬†Where. The. Government. Creates. Shortages. To. Go. Along. With. Their. Covid. Hysteria. And. Mandate. After. Mandate,‚Äù one said. ¬†\n\n¬†links to the same image, which it says is a screenshot from a tracking app. ‚ÄúIf you want to put a sinister twist on this, imagine a government putting a choke hold on goods entering the U.S.,‚Äù the post says. ‚ÄúThen, releasing everything in October they brag about the surge in 4th quarter spending and the robust economy they&#8217;ve created.‚Äù ¬†\n\nIn fact, c argo traffic has been rising since the pandemic took hold, as homebound Americans began ordering goods online, with  waiting to enter ports at Los Angeles and Long Beach. Marine terminals and trucking companies have been unable to keep up with the volume, resulting in bottlenecks at ports and rail yards from California to New York.  ¬†\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pandemic-driven buying surge unlike one that we‚Äôve ever seen from the American consumer,‚Äù , executive director of the Port of Los Angeles,  at a  in February. Meanwhile , COVID-19 has kept many workers away from their jobs, and rail, truck, terminal and vessel operators are struggling to keep up, Seroka said. ¬†¬†\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated a situation that‚Äôs been building for years, as growing consumer demand for imported products comes up against an aging supply chain,¬†  president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, said in an interview with FactCheck.org. ¬†\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen this amount of cargo,‚Äù McLaurin said. ‚ÄúAt some point, you can‚Äôt violate the laws of physics. You can only move it so fast; you can only pile it so high, and then you just run out of space. We‚Äôre at that point, and we have been for a while.‚Äù ¬†\n\nIndustry officials and observers dismissed the idea that the Biden administration is deliberately causing the logjam. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not something anyone in the industry is talking about,‚Äù McLaurin said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see that.‚Äù\n\nThe problem isn‚Äôt unique to the U.S., he noted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening all over the world. There‚Äôs congestion throughout the supply chain.‚Äù  ¬†\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated that congestion, as consumers shifted spending to goods and away from travel and entertainment,  ,  the Washington Post reported.\n\n‚ÄúBecause of the pandemic, there was a huge spike in demand, and obviously that increased U.S. imports from Asia,‚Äù  assistant professor at Rowan University‚Äôs Rohrer College of Business, told us in a joint phone interview with a colleague, .\n\nWest Coast ports, which handle the bulk of U.S. imports from Asia, are feeling much of the strain, Kuppusamy said.  ¬† ¬†\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles saw¬† , and expects ‚Äúsignificant volume headed our way throughout this year and into 2022,‚Äù Seroka said at a press briefing in September.  ¬†\n\nPorts and warehouses are overwhelmed with cargo containers that have nowhere to go. A shortage of chassis ‚Äî the platforms used to transport containers once they are unloaded from ships ‚Äî is contributing to the backup, as vessels arriving at ports can‚Äôt offload their cargo, Kuppusamy said.  ¬†\n\n‚ÄúIf you have a system that has limited capacity across the board and a spike in demand, most parts of the supply chain system will not be able to function fully,‚Äù Kuppusamy explained. ‚ÄúThat will create this cumulative effect of reduced product flow throughout the supply chain.&#8221;\n\n‚ÄúThe current administration has inherited that infrastructure with limited capacity,‚Äù said Kabir, also an¬†assistant professor at¬†Rowan.¬†Biden‚Äôs¬† ¬†includes billions of dollars in funding for port infrastructure, as well as money for rail,¬†and the administration has¬†formed a task force on supply chain disruption and¬†named a¬†  to work to resolve the congestion at U.S. ports, Kabir noted. ¬†\n\n‚ÄúAll these things collectively probably weaken the argument significantly that the Biden administration is slowing things down, or they are not serious about this issue,‚Äù¬†Kabir said. ¬†\n\n‚ÄúIncentive alignment,‚Äù such as offering port workers bonuses tied to faster processing of cargo, could help the situation, Kabir added. ‚ÄúWe often see that if your payment is fixed irrespective of your output, you do not get motivation.‚Äù\n\nThere continue to be shortages of workers at ports as well as shortages of truckers to drive cargo from the ports, said  a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School. That‚Äôs true ‚Äúat almost every port around the world,‚Äù he said. ¬†\n\nAcross the supply chain, ‚Äúpeople are waiting on the sidelines to decide whether they really want to go back to work,‚Äù Allon said. FedEx Corp., he noted, recently¬†  and said the labor market was partly responsible. ‚ÄúThe shortage of drivers and trucks and port workers is a global phenomenon,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúNo one wants to work in these conditions,‚Äù Allon continued. Companies are offering incentives ‚Äì such as Amazon‚Äôs recent announcement of  ¬†‚Äî to entice people to work for them, he noted.¬† ¬†\n\nA coalition of transport groups, including the International Chamber of Shipping, wrote an   to world leaders calling for an end to ‚Äúfragmented‚Äù travel rules and seeking priority vaccination status for transport workers. ‚ÄúIt is of great concern that we are also seeing shortages of workers and expect more to leave our industries as a result of the poor treatment they have faced during the pandemic, putting the supply chain under greater threat,‚Äù the letter said. ¬†\n\n‚ÄúThe issue with systems that are highly congested is that any small disruption multiplies and amplifies the waiting time,‚Äù Allon said, comparing the port situation to a traffic backup resulting from¬†a lane closure.¬† ¬†\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a system that is just completely overwhelmed and drowning in cargo at this point,‚Äù McLaurin said. ‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs trying to do the best job they can to work their way through it.‚Äù ¬†\n\nEditor‚Äôs note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations¬† ¬†to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

Although children still are less likely than adults, especially older adults, to be hospitalized or die from Covid,  were admitted to hospitals with Covid in August, the highest levels to date during the pandemic.\n\nThe hospitalization rate in mid-August for children and adolescents with confirmed Covid was nearly five times the rate in late June, according to  released earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate climbed nearly tenfold among children newborn to 4 years old, the report found.\n\nCovid-related emergency room visits and hospital admissions also increased among children in mid-August, according to .\n\nGeography played a role, the researchers found. Those visits and admissions occurred 3.4 and 3.7 times more in the states with lower vaccination rates.\n\nParental anxiety has fueled the demand for slots in children‚Äôs vaccine trials and made appointments scarce. Pfizer, for instance, is fully booked in its clinical trial, a spokesperson said.\n\nSo Ms. Vong Reiff most likely nabbed a cancellation slot in Nebraska.Image Logan and Quentin Reiff were given comic book handouts as part of their participation in new vaccine trials.¬† Credit... Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times  Dr. Tina Sosa, a mother of two, did not have to travel far to get her son vaccinated in a trial. A pediatric hospitalist, Dr. Sosa was on a fellowship at Cincinnati Children‚Äôs Hospital Medical Center when Pfizer began a trial there.\n\nHer older son, Brandon, 3, had no side effects from the two shots he received in April, she said. ‚ÄúI even squeezed his arm and asked did it hurt, and he said no.‚Äù\n\nDr. Sosa has since moved to Rochester, N.Y., where she works at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Her 7-month-old son, Leo, is to begin a Moderna trial next month, while Brandon will follow up on his trial in Cincinnati via an app and telephone, Dr. Sosa said.Updated¬† Nov. 7, 2021, 1:49 p.m. ET\n\nIn his push for vaccine mandates on Thursday, President Biden expressed the need to develop vaccines to protect children younger than 12.\n\n‚ÄúNow if you‚Äôre a parent of a young child and you‚Äôre wondering when will it be, when will it be ‚Äî the vaccine ‚Äî available for them, I strongly support independent scientific review for vaccine uses for children under 12,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take shortcuts of that scientific work.‚Äù\n\nThe three major U.S. drug companies making vaccines are at different stages when it comes to children‚Äôs trials.\n\nPfizer is conducting a single trial for children under 12, Kit Longley, a spokesman, said.\n\nThe trial has included 4,500 children: 3,000 who are 5 to 11; 750 who are 2 to 5; and 750 who are 6 months to 2 years.The company anticipates having its trial data for children ages 5 to 11 later this month, and after more review, potentially will request F.D.A. emergency use authorization for that age group, Mr. Longley said Friday.\n\nModerna announced on Thursday   that the company had finished its enrollment of children ages 6 to 11, totaling 4,000 children, for its trial. The company said it expected to file for F.D.A. emergency-use authorization for that age group by the end of this year.\n\nAnother application should be filed in early 2022, the company said, based on the results of a trial for children 5 and younger. In all, Moderna expected to enroll about 12,000 children, Colleen Hussey, a company spokeswoman, said.\n\nJohnson &amp; Johnson has started its Phase 3 clinical trial in adolescents from 12 to 17, and will submit the findings to regulators when finished, according to a company spokesman, Jake Sargent.\n\nThe company is also planning several other studies, he said. One will include children from 6 to 11, followed by children 2 to 5. Another will look at those younger than 2.Image Jennifer and David Macklom with their daughters: Ruth, 2; Naomi, 5; and Miriam, 8. The Mackloms enrolled their two oldest daughters in a Pfizer vaccine trial. Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times  \n\nImpatient parents who are seeking off-label adult shots for their children concern officials like Dr. Sean O‚ÄôLeary, vice chairman of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of the Wild West out there,‚Äù said Dr. O‚ÄôLeary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado.\n\nJennifer Macklom of Cedar Park, Texas, was determined to get her three daughters enrolled in a trial. Haunting her were the memories of 2016, when her daughter Miriam had grown sick with an adenovirus at age 2 ¬Ω. Simultaneously, her daughter Naomi, who was only 6 weeks old at the time, contracted a form of the coronavirus that pre-dated Covid.\n\nMiriam was taken by ambulance to the Dell Children‚Äôs Medical Center in Austin. Naomi was admitted through its emergency room.\n\nBoth girls were hooked up on oxygen and feeding tubes at the same time, Ms. Macklom recalled.\n\n‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that again. I can‚Äôt emotionally have anyone I love or even know be hooked up to one of these things,‚Äô‚Äù said Ms. Macklom, a high school mathematics teacher.\n\nSo, with the advent of the pandemic, she conferred with her pediatrician, and all three children landed on a waiting list for a vaccine trial. Miriam is now 8, Naomi, 5, and Ruth, 2.Image Naomi Macklom playing in an inner tube with her sisters, Ruth, far left, and Miriam, in goggles, in the family&rsquo;s backyard. Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times  \n\nFive months passed. Then the phone rang, and Ms. Macklom learned that her daughters were at the top of the list to receive the Pfizer vaccine at a branch of Austin Regional Clinic, in central Texas.So many parents were interested in that trial for the under-12 age group that the staff had no need to recruit them, according to Heidi Shalev, a clinic spokeswoman.\n\nRuth was too young for vaccinations at that site. Now, to avoid the risk of contracting the virus at day care, she is spending weekdays with Ms. Macklom‚Äôs parents.\n\nMiriam and Naomi got their two shots. They don‚Äôt know if they contained the vaccine, since this trial called for one-third of shots to be a placebo. The children had to wait for an hour after the injections, and the staff gave them a coloring book and rice crispy treats.\n\nThe girls will learn in early winter if they got the vaccine or the placebo. If it is the placebo, they will receive shots of the real stuff.\n\n‚ÄúGetting in the study was so life-changing,‚Äù Ms. Macklom said. ‚ÄúWe actually went out camping.‚ÄùImage Naomi showing off an &ldquo;I Was Vaccinated&rdquo; patch.¬† Credit... Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times  Ms. Vong Reiff, who owns her own marketing firm, also decided to enroll her sons in the trial to protect her husband, who underwent surgery and radiation for nonmalignant meningioma, she said.\n\nIn mid-August, the entire family headed to Maine, to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park, and then to Boston for a duck boat tour.\n\n‚ÄúHad the boys not been vaccinated, we wouldn‚Äôt have gone,‚Äù Ms. Vong Reiff said. ‚ÄúFor us, it was a kind of celebration to be vaccinated, slowly getting back to who we were.‚Äù\n\nAdvertisement                                                                            ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/girl-scouts-vaccinated/'),

Trump departs Washington with Americans more politically divided and more likely to be out of work than when he arrived, while awaiting trial for his second impeachment - an ignominious end to one of the most turbulent presidencies in American history. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg If you‚Äôve lived through the last five years and haven‚Äôt been forced to medicate yourself to the point of unconsciousness, you‚Äôre probably aware that Donald Trump has been very bad for society, on account of the  and the  and the  and the ,  . Because of that, it would be ideal if neither the 45th president nor his acolytes sat at the seat of power ever again, though, unfortunately, that‚Äôs no sure thing. For one thing, Republicans have a shot at flipping the Senate in 2022, and there are a disturbing number of GOP lawmakers there whom Trump has   . For another, Trump is  ‚Äúlaying the groundwork‚Äù for a 2024 run, and if you recall, 74 million people  for him in 2020, which wasn‚Äôt enough to actually win but was a disturbing number nevertheless.\n\nObviously also at issue is that since Trump lost to Joe Biden, Republicans have responded by attempting to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible. Allies of the former guy have been  to meddle in future elections by passing bills that ‚Äúallow Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds,‚Äù which would, per The Atlantic, let state legislatures or their appointees interfere ‚Äúin local decision-making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona, Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020: throw out ballots in rival strongholds in order to overturn a statewide result.‚Äù Which is bone-chillingly terrifying.\n\nBut you know what would be great? If somehow we could wave a magic wand and ensure that none of the people who support Trump or Trump-endorsed candidates show up to vote, which would be a tremendous turn of events for humanity, though one that would clearly never happen unless‚Äîwhat? What‚Äôs that you say? Donald Trump has, in an incredible self-own, told his base to stay home and not vote in the next two elections?Twitter content\n\nSetting aside for a moment the idea of Trump instructing millions of people not to vote, which would have the obvious effect of helping the other side, it‚Äôs important to note that Trump is still‚Äîstill!‚Äîclinging to the idea that the 2020 election was stolen and there is a chance it could be overturned and he could be ‚Äú‚Äù at the White House. That‚Äôs extremely scary because, in case anyone missed it the first thousand times, there is absolutely zero evidence that fraud played a role in the last election, despite multiple attempts by conservatives to conduct ‚Äúaudits‚Äù of results in battleground states, which have thus far .\n\nNevertheless, we absolutely love the idea of Trump throwing a hissy fit and saying, ‚ÄúOh yeah? You won‚Äôt overturn Joe Biden‚Äôs win? My people will show you!‚Äù First, because it underscores how very, very stupid he is, and second, because he and his allies have done this in the past and it predictably worked out great for Democrats.\n\nAs the Daily Beast :\n\nAfter prominent Trump supporters similarly told Georgia Republicans to¬†sit out the two runoffs¬†in that state late last year, calling it ‚Äúanother rigged election,‚Äù voters ended up giving Democrats control of the Senate.\n\nAs Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings  Politico in January, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs on [Trump]. He told them their votes didn‚Äôt count, and some of them listened.‚Äù\n\nIn a sad attempt to spin Trump‚Äôs directive as the exact opposite of what he said, GOP rally organizer John Fredericks  The Washington Post he thought Trump was simply warning voters that they need to get more involved to safeguard future elections, an explanation we‚Äôre sure the ex-president will blow up by clarifying that no, he specifically meant for people to stay home.\n\nIf you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click¬†¬†to¬†subscribe.More Great Stories From Vanity Fair¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\n‚Äî How Sarah Everard‚Äôs Murder Revealed \r\n‚Äî  for Trying to Overturn the Election in Georgia\r\n‚Äî Congressman Adam Schiff Describes \r\n‚Äî Surprise:  for Trump‚Äôs Disastrous COVID Address\r\n‚Äî Inside a Father‚Äôs Desperate Quest to \r\n‚Äî  May Be‚Ä¶Conor Lamb\r\n‚Äî Cori Bush Is Ready to \r\n‚Äî Jared and Ivanka Fancy Themselves the \r\n‚Äî From the Archive:  That Brought Down the Gucci Dynasty\r\n‚Äî Not a subscriber?  to receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now. is a politics correspondent at Vanity Fair.Get the Hive NewsletterThe freshest-and most essential-updates from Washington, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley.Enter your e-mail addressSign Up  \n\nBy signing up you agree to our  and .

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan)\n\nMGA Entertainment CEO Isaac Larian  today about a recent announcement by the Biden administration, &#8220;Whether the ports are open 24 hours a day or 48 hours a day, you cannot get labor.\n\n&#8220;If you cannot get labor, you cannot get trucks, you cannot get the merchandise out,&#8221; the toymaker executive explained.\n\nLarian added, &#8220;I think this directive is too little, too late. And frankly, it&#8217;s a political gimmick to me.&#8221;\n\nOn Sept. 17, the LA Times  about the record number of cargo ships that were anchored or drifting offshore, waiting to enter the L.A. and Long Beach ports to be unloaded.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged during her press briefing yesterday that the White House &#8220;cannot guarantee&#8221; that Christmas presents will arrive on time.\n\nPsaki suggested that the delays might be due to consumer shipping services instead, similar to last year when there was some hiccups with them.\n\n&#8220;We are not the Postal Service, UPS or FedEx. We cannot guarantee. What we can do is use every lever at the federal government‚Äôs disposal to reduce delays, to ensure we are addressing bottlenecks in the system, including ports and the need for them to be open longer hours so that goods can arrive. And we continue to press ‚Äî not only workers and unions ‚Äî but also companies to take as many steps as they can to reduce these delays,&#8221; Psaki insisted.\n\nOf course, those delays were only for those unwilling to pick their products up at the store. These delays will certainly have greater implications.

In these two clips you can see that he doesn&#39;t have any sort of plan. If he explained what he was standing up for, besides being unvaccinated, the internet doesn&#39;t appear to have caught it.\n\nKyrie Irving address his stance on not getting the vaccine on IG Live: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about choosing what‚Äôs best for you. You think I really want to lose money? You think I really want to give up on my dream to go after a championship? You think I really just want to give up my job?‚Äù ‚Äî Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes)\n\nHe says it&#39;s about doing what&#39;s best for himself, which doesn&#39;t sound like the &#34;voice for the voiceless&#34; thing is true. He just sounds like he didn&#39;t think he needed to get the vaccine so he didn&#39;t get the vaccine. The most painful part is his insistence that he will not be used as part of an agenda.

He mentions &#34;people losing jobs to these mandates,&#34; but doesn&#39;t elaborate. He just keeps saying he wants to speak for himself. When he finally does, he has nothing to say.\n\nKyrie Irving speaks ‚Äî NBA Central (@TheNBACentral)\n\nGetting vaccinated seems like an easy way to fix that and he doesn&#39;t explain why you shouldn&#39;t get vaccinated beyond the fact that it is a choice. People also have the choice to stand in the middle of the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic in front of Barclays, but we should probably discourage it.\n\nPlenty of people dropped by to show Kyrie support in his fight against public health and Stephon Marbury stole the show claiming that Irving was &#34;.&#34; He also compared Irving to Muhammad Ali, a popular refrain over the last 24 hours. As with most anti-vax sentiments, it doesn&#39;t hold water.\n\nMuhammad Ali protested Vietnam and went to jail. Kyrie Irving is refusing a shot for reasons that he can&#39;t even clearly express. Ali shot a commercial in 1978 to encourage kids to get vaccinated so they could go to school. Ali&#39;s widow .\n\nThere is no comparision.

All of that is a lie. Its not what happened,\" he added.\n\n\"Weve spoken to several people with direct knowledge of what actually did happen. We can tell you that the shutdown of Southwest Airlines over the weekend was a direct consequence, it was a reaction to, s vaccine mandates.\"\n\nCarlson claimed that some pilots are refusing to take the vaccine because they have immunity from already having the virus, claiming religious exemption, or have expressed concerns about potential side-effects.\n\n\"Yet others are taking a stand purely on principle,  Carlson said. \"They believe that in a free country, politicians should never be allowed to force citizens to submit to medical treatment they dont want.\"\n\nThe speculation about the cancellations arrived as SWAPA stated last week that they would be filing a Temporary Restraining Order in order to stop  (File photo) A man with a Gadsden flag, a U.S. flag, and a Confederate battle flag listens to a speaker during the Kentucky Freedom Rally at the capitol building on August 28, 2021 in Frankfort, Kentucky.

None of the reports have named the pilot or details of the pilots flight.\n\nIn a recent broadcast of The Stew Peters Show, a videocast and podcast hosted by an anti-vaccination activist, Peters and his guest repeated the story.\n\nPeters guest, Dr. Jane Ruby, attributed the story to an unnamed source who was allegedly connected to a Delta flight attendant.\n\nRuby is not a medical doctor, according to PolitiFact.

Graphene oxide is not found in any of the COVID-19 vaccines, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn his broadcast about the dead pilot, Peters said, \"Delta Airlines is keeping this from the media.... Were assuming or speculating that this happened within the last two weeks.\"\n\nPeters then asked any Delta employees who worked on the flight to contact him with any additional information.\n\nHis previous broadcasts have claimed that the COVID-19 vaccine contains the \"final variant\" of the virus which is part of an \"AI alien extinction plan.\"\n\nNumerous studies cited by the  and the World Health Organization have found that the vaccines side effects are rare and rarely lethal.\n\nThe story about the pilot may be circulating among anti-vaccination activists in an attempt to sway public opinion against Democratic President s federal vaccine mandate requiring vaccinations for all employees of major airlines with federal contracts.\n\nDelta Airlines is the only major U.S. airline that  for all its employees.\n\nCurrent Delta employees who choose not to get vaccinated must pay a $200 monthly penalty starting in November, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

(41, 'Cleveland Indians change name to Guardians', 'https://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-change-name-to-guardians', '                     In this section Featured In this section Featured AL East AL Central AL West NL East NL Central NL West search-525868 Sign in Shareshare-square-1150281July 23rd, 2021\n\nMandy BellShareshare-square-1150282\n\nCLEVELAND -- The city&#39;s MLB team officially has its new name. \n\nThe team announced through a video posted to its Twitter account on Friday morning that it will be changing its name from the Cleveland Indians to the Cleveland Guardians. The name will go into effect following the conclusion of the 2021 season. \n\n‚ÄúThere were a lot of challenges to find the right name and then make sure the name was available for use,‚Äù team owner and chairman Paul Dolan said. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of time and a lot of extraordinary effort. Add to that, it was all done during a global pandemic. ‚Ä¶ I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s finally over. But I am glad that we&#39;ve entered the phase now where the name is out there and we can begin to promote what will be our future. That&#39;s actually exciting.‚Äù \n\nFirst thing‚Äôs first:  \n\nThe organization wanted something that paid tribute to its community and its franchise‚Äôs history. After 40,000 fans were surveyed and 140 hours of interviews were conducted with those fans, community leaders and front-office personnel, all signs pointed toward the Guardians being the best fit. \n\nProgressive Field looms in the background when facing the 43-foot ‚ÄúGuardians of Traffic‚Äù that have stood tall for nearly 100 years on the Hope Memorial Bridge. These sculptures are meant to symbolize progress, a concept that‚Äôs now trickling over to the city‚Äôs baseball team. \n\n‚ÄúWe think Guardians is unique and authentic to Cleveland,‚Äù Cleveland‚Äôs president of business operations Brian Barren said. ‚ÄúIt&#39;s less about the Guardians of Traffic and more about what the Guardians represent and that idea of protection. For us and our research, Cleveland folks are very protective of one another. They&#39;re protective of our city, they&#39;re protective of &#39;The Land&#39; and everything about it. \n\n‚ÄúThat&#39;s one key component, the resiliency of people here in Cleveland and Northeast Ohio and the loyalty. The loyalty to Cleveland, the loyalty to one another as teammates, as co-workers, as family and friends. Those all become part of what &#39;Guardians&#39; really starts to evoke from an emotional standpoint.‚Äù \n\n‚Ä¢  \n\nAs far as ties to the club‚Äôs history, the Cleveland Guardians will boast the same blue-and-red-color scheme fans have grown familiar with. The organization wanted the script to be similar to what it has been for the past 75 years, but it decided to make slight changes to mimic the structural architecture of the Hope Memorial Bridge, imitating the trusses of the bridge‚Äôs underside. On the road, the team will continue to sport ‚ÄúCleveland‚Äù across its chest, while ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù will be printed on the home jerseys. \n\nA list that started at approximately 1,200 potential nicknames was whittled down to just one: the Guardians. Neither Barren nor Dolan said what other names were considered finalists in this process, but Barren noted that the polls fans and other local outlets ran to vote on their favorite options often reflected the organization‚Äôs top choices, as well. \n\n‚Ä¢  \n\nSo why unveil this now? The team had no intentions of doing this in the middle of the season when it decided to officially change the name over the winter, but the club had agreed to release the name as soon as it had received all legal clearances and approvals. When that happened on Thursday night, Cleveland knew it had to act fast if it wanted to be in control of the release. And now that it‚Äôs official and the club is eyeing 2022 for the new nickname to be implemented, it needed to have ample time to prepare. \n\n‚ÄúYou&#39;ve got to get your name out there soon enough so that manufacturers can start on merchandise, uniforms and all that kind of stuff,‚Äù Dolan said. ‚ÄúThey would have preferred more time than we&#39;re giving them.‚Äù \n\nBut this is a change that the club wants to make as soon as possible. As of now, the organization has to work through the logistics of when the beloved ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù sign will be removed from above the left-field scoreboard (and likely replaced with a ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù sign, as Dolan indicated) and all the other branding changes at the ballpark will be done over the three-plus-month offseason. \n\nWhen it was first announced that Cleveland was going to change its moniker, many fans took to Twitter to express the desire and excitement over the possibility of renaming the team the ‚ÄúSpiders‚Äù after the 1890s professional baseball team that was located in Cleveland. Why was that not the route the club took for 2022? Get the Latest From MLB\n\nSign up to receive our daily  to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Sign up \n\n‚ÄúSpiders was an interesting consideration early on in the process,‚Äù Barren said. ‚ÄúThere were some pros and cons to it. On the cons side, you had some teams that struggled on the field. There were also some great Spiders teams. It tended to be more of an affinity to, &#39;Gosh, the last time we had a Spiders Major League Baseball team, it wasn‚Äôt necessarily a good thing.&#39; Again, as we try to respect the rich heritage of Major League Baseball, we wanted to find a launching point where it‚Äôs a clean slate, we got a lot of room to grow with Guardians moving forward.‚Äù¬† \n\nCleveland first announced last summer that it would begin having conversations with local community members and Native American groups about the possibility of a name change. After what it learned during that process, the organization announced in December that it was beginning a search for its fifth name in franchise history -- and the first change since 1915. \n\n‚ÄúWe do feel like we&#39;re doing the right thing, and that&#39;s what&#39;s driving this,‚Äù Dolan said. ‚ÄúI know some people disagree, but if anything, I&#39;ve gotten more and more comfortable that we&#39;re headed in the right direction. And actually, the selection of the name solidifies that feeling because of the values that the name represents. We feel very, very good about that part.‚Äù¬† \n\n‚ÄúWe&#39;re enjoying today as the launching point,‚Äù Barren said, ‚Äúbut also taking a deep breath because we&#39;ve got a marathon in front of us to get ready for Opening Day next year.‚Äù              ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jon-bon-jovi-washing-dishes/'),

He is a former head writer at VIVA Travel Guides.             Updated May 17, 2021    On the second Monday of October each year, millions of Americans celebrate Columbus Day, one of  &nbsp;The tale of Christopher Columbus, the legendary Genoese explorer and navigator, ‚Äãhas been retold and rewritten many times. To some, he was an intrepid explorer, following his instincts to a New World. To others, he was a monster, a trader of enslaved people who unleashed the horrors of the conquest on unsuspecting Indigenous societies. What are the facts about Christopher Columbus?‚Äã\n\n Schoolchildren are taught that  wanted to find America, or in some cases that he wanted to prove that the world was round. He convinced  to finance the journey, and she sold her personal jewelry to do so. He bravely headed west and found the Americas and the Caribbean, making friends with Indigenous peoples along the way. He returned to Spain in glory, having discovered the New World.\n\n What&#39;s wrong with this story? Quite a bit, actually.\n\n The theory that the Earth was flat and that it was possible to sail off its edge was common in , but it had been discredited by Columbus time. His  did help fix one common mistake, however: it proved that the Earth was much larger than people had previously thought.\n\n Columbus, basing his calculations on incorrect assumptions about the size of the Earth, assumed it would be possible to reach the rich markets of eastern Asia by sailing west. Had he succeeded in finding a new trade route, it would have made him a very wealthy man. Instead, he found the Caribbean, then inhabited by cultures with little in the way of gold, silver, or trade goods. Unwilling to completely abandon his calculations, Columbus made a laughingstock of himself back in Europe by claiming that the Earth was not round but shaped like a pear. He had not found Asia, he said, because of the bulging part of the pear.\n\n He didn&#39;t need to. Isabella and her husband Ferdinand, fresh from the conquest of Moorish kingdoms in the south of Spain, had more than enough money to send someone like Columbus sailing off to the west in three second-rate ships. He had tried to get financing from other kingdoms like England and Portugal with no success. Strung along on vague promises, Columbus hung around the Spanish court for years. In fact, he had just given up and was headed to France to try his luck there when word reached him that the Spanish king and queen had decided to finance his 1492 voyage.\n\n The Europeans, with ships, guns, fancy clothes, and shiny trinkets, made quite an impression on the tribes of the Caribbean. Columbus made a good impression when he wanted to. For example, he made friends with a local cacique on the Island of Hispaniola named Guacanagari because .\n\n But Columbus also captured and enslaved other Indigenous peoples. The practice of enslavement was common and legal in Europe at the time, and the  was very lucrative. Columbus never forgot that his voyage was not one of exploration, but of economics. His financing came from the hope that he would find a lucrative new trade route. He did nothing of the sort: the people he met had little to trade. An opportunist, he captured Indigenous people to show that they would make good enslaved workers. Years later, he would be devastated to learn that Queen Isabella had decided to declare the New World off-limits to enslavers.\n\n Again, this one is half-true. At first, most observers in Spain considered his first voyage a total fiasco. He had not found a new trade route and the most valuable of his three ships, the Santa Maria, had sunk. Later, when people began to realize that the lands he had found were previously unknown, his stature grew and he was able to get funding for a&nbsp;&nbsp;of exploration and colonization.\n\n As for discovering the Americas, many people have pointed out over the years that for something to be discovered it must first be ‚Äúlost,‚Äù and the millions of people already living in the New World certainly didn‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúdiscovered.‚Äù\n\n But more than that, Columbus stubbornly stuck to his guns for the rest of his life. He always believed that the lands he found were the easternmost fringe of Asia and that the rich markets of Japan and India were just a little farther away. He even put forth his absurd pear-shaped Earth theory in order to make the facts fit his assumptions. It wasn‚Äôt long before everyone around him figured out that the New World was something previously unseen by Europeans, but Columbus himself went to the grave without admitting that they were right.\n\n Since his death in 1506,  has undergone many revisions and been interpreted by historians in a variety of ways. He is vilified by Indigenous rights groups today, and rightly so, yet he was once seriously considered for sainthood.\n\n Columbus may have been a talented sailor, navigator, and ship captain. He went west without a map, trusting his instincts and calculations, and was very loyal to his patrons, the king and queen of Spain. Because of it, they rewarded him by sending him to the New World a total of four times. And yet, while Columbus might have had some admirable qualities as an explorer, most popular accounts of him today fail to highlight the significance of his crimes against Indigenous peoples.\n\n Columbus did not have an abundance of admirers during his time. He and other explorers brought awful diseases, such as smallpox, to which the Indigenous men and women of the New World had no defenses, and their population is estimated to have declined by as much as 90%.  Columbus was also a heartless enslaver who took people away from their families in order to lessen his failure to find a new trade route. Many of his contemporaries despised these actions. As governor of  in Hispaniola, he was a despot who kept all profits for himself and his brothers and was loathed by the colonists whose lives he controlled. Attempts were made on his life and he was actually sent back to Spain in chains at one point after .\n\n During , he and his men were stranded in Jamaica for a year when his ships rotted. No one wanted to travel there from Hispaniola to save him. He was also dishonest and selfish. After promising a reward to whoever spotted land first on his 1492 voyage, he refused to pay up when sailor Rodrigo de Triana did so, giving the reward to himself instead because he had seen a ‚Äúglow‚Äù the night before.\n\n Those who voice disdain for anti-Columbus historians may feel like the explorer&#39;s legacy is shouldering the weight of crimes that not only he committed. It is true that he was not the only person who enslaved or killed Indigenous peoples, and perhaps written histories should more explicitly acknowledge this fact. In this way, Columbus might then be more widely seen as one of several major explorers who collectively contributed to the decimation of Indigenous civilizations in the New World.

Whenever my family did cook we always gave thanks that all the Native Americans werent wiped out when Columbus \"discovered\" America. I never understood why my family was so against Thanksgiving. In school we drew turkeys with our hands and it was a happy time. It meant a couple of days off from school. My teachers made it seem like Thanksgiving was a holiday to look forward to. The New York City public education system told me what Thanksgiving was all about. I was very careful to regurgitate what they taught me when tested so I wouldnt get a failing grade. When I was older though I was told the truth by my family. \n\nMy great, great, great, great grandfather was a part of a band of Black Indians in Florida, hence my unique and Native American-sounding last name. It seems I come from a long line of warriors and activists. I am a revolutionary not by choice but by lineage. When I did finally learn, there was no stopping me. Whenever someone asked what I was doing for Thanksgiving I proudly stated that I no longer celebrate it. Thanksgiving day should be known as National Land Theft and American Genocide Day.

Armed settlers -- which we tell our children were God fearing, gentle, sharing, kind Pilgrims -- invaded a Pequot village. They also set the village, which included many children, on fire. Those who were lucky enough to escape the fire were systematically sought, hunted down and killed. While many, including historians, still debate what exactly happened this day, also known as the Pequot Massacre, it directly led to the creation of \"Thanksgiving Day.\" This is what the governor of Bay Colony had to  days after the massacre, \"A day of thanksgiving. Thanking God that they had eliminated over 700 men, women and children.\"\n\nWilliam B. Newell, a Penobscot Indian and former chairman of the Anthropology Department at the University of Connecticut stated, \"Gathered in this place of meeting, they were attacked by mercenaries and English and Dutch. The Indians were ordered from the building and as they came forth were shot down, The rest were burned alive in the building. The very next day the governor declared a Thanksgiving Day. For the next 100 years, every Thanksgiving Day ordained by a Governor was in honor of the bloody victory, thanking God that the battle had been won.\" \n\nWhen I finally found out the origins of Thanksgiving it made me nauseous. Never again will I celebrate a holiday I know nothing about until I investigate its origins. I am very thankful, pun intended, that I learned about the origins of this holiday. It is a reminder that history can be rewritten and if told enough times eventually becomes the truth!\n\nPeople always tell me to forget the past. I should just let it go and move on. Why do people of color always have to forget?! Would you tell a Jewish person to forget about the holocaust and just move on?! Would you tell the family of those who lost their lives on 9/11 to just forget about it?! So why are our tragedies forgettable and others are not?! I WILL NEVER forget! I will ALWAYS honor those who lost their lives unjustifiable. \n\nSo when you sit down to dinner this year, look at your family, serve the food and tell each other what you are most thankful for, think about the origins of Thanksgiving. Think about the countless Native Americans who lost their lives so you can carve a turkey and get the best deals on Black Friday. Say a prayer for them, especially the children, who died simply because of the color of their skin.\n\nCustomer Service Racial BiasSuggest a correctionMore:     TrendingNewsletter Sign UpBlack VoicesAmplifying Black voices through news that matters.Successfully Subscribed!Stories that matter delivered to your inbox        Whats HotMore In Black Voices    Part of HuffPost Black Voices. ¬©2021 BuzzFeed, Inc.

The game was halted 14 minutes into the second half while the referee, Rodrigo Crivellaro, was taken to hospital. He was later released.\n\n‚ÄúI decided ‚Ä¶ to charge the lad with attempted murder because in my perception of the case he took the risk of [inflicting] a lethal outcome,‚Äù the officer in charge of the case told the Brazilian website UOL.\n\nThe attack took place on Sport Club S√£o Paulo‚Äôs 113th anniversary. The club called the incident ‚Äúone of the saddest in its history‚Äù and said they had summarily fired Ribeiro and was examining what further action they may take.\n\nThe small club from Rio Grande, a city of about 200,000 people approximately 320km south of the state capital Porto Alegre, play in the second division of the Rio Grande do Sul state championship. The match on Monday was halted and restarted a day later with Guarani winning 1-0, the state football federation said.Topics ¬© 2021 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The agency announced Sunday that its sending spacecraft above the Earth to crash into an asteroids moonlet to change the bodys trajectory.&nbsp;\n\nThe mission, a Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), will be the first agencys use of the kinetic impactor technique, in which a large, high-speed spacecraft is sent into an asteroids path to change its motion. NASA is set to conduct the mission, what it calls \"the first test for planetary defense,\" on November 24, the day before Thanksgiving, to hit the binary near-Earth asteroid Didymos and its moonlet, Dimorphos.&nbsp;     &#9732;&#65039;  at  entails finding, tracking, and characterizing near-Earth  and objects. Here&rsquo;s what weve found thus far. Our , launching this November, will also be our first test for planetary defense.\n\nLearn more at  &mdash; NASA Asteroid Watch (@AsteroidWatch)\n\nThe asteroid is roughly 780 meters across &mdash; about 2,559 feet, according to . Its moonlet is about 525 feet, which according to NASA, is \"more typical of the size of asteroids that could pose the most likely significant threat to Earth.\"&nbsp;\n\nThe DART spacecraft will crash into the moonlet  at about 6.6 kilometers per second, a speed thats faster than a bullet and rapid enough to change the speed of the moonlet by a fraction of 1%, NASA says. Though it appears like a small change, this impact will change the orbital period of the moonlet by several minutes.&nbsp;\n\nDART will be launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, but its not going to crash into the asteroids moon for another 10 months. NASA said that it will be cruising in space until September 2022, when the Didymos system is within 11 million kilometers of Earth.&nbsp;     \n\nThe  is &rsquo;s first  test mission and will impact an asteroid to demonstrate a technique that could be used in the future to protect Earth from a potential impact.  on November 24! Learn more:  &mdash; NASA Asteroid Watch (@AsteroidWatch)\n\nThe mission is reminiscent of the 1998 sci-fi action movie \"Armageddon,\" in which the space agency deploys a team of civilians to land on an asteroid and detonate it before it destroys Earth. While the basic idea to the movie is similar, however, NASA has said that neither Didymos nor Dimorphos pose a  to Earth. This particular mission, the agency says, is so that scientists can calculate how effective DART missions can be.&nbsp;\n\nThe distance from Earth that the asteroid and its moonlet will be at the time of the collision is close enough that telescopes will be able to observe what happens.&nbsp;                               Space &amp; Astronomy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nLi Cohen is a social media producer and trending reporter for CBS News, focusing on social justice issues.

The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life.Keywords: COVID-19 vaccines, Vaccine ethics, Fetal cell line ethics Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines. A Pew Research Survey conducted in February 2021 found that 36% of Protestants and 22% of Catholics are unwilling to be vaccinated; subgroup analyses found that 45% of white evangelicals and 33% of black Protestants are unwilling . Although many reasons underlie this hesitancy, one area of reported concerns is that receiving such vaccines implicates the recipient with cooperation with abortion. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs.\n\nIn an article published in Vaccine in 2004, I reported on an analysis of ethical concerns raised on web sites about vaccines grown in human tissue cultures that were originally derived from abortions . The web sites raised a variety of concerns including lack of respect for fetal body parts, implication of material cooperation in abortion, vaccination implies agreement with abortion, profiteering from abortion, and autonomy.\n\nCell lines developed from past abortions are used in the testing or development of certain COVID-19 vaccines. The HEK 293 cell line was developed in Holland in the early 1970s from embryonal kidney tissue from a supposedly therapeutic abortion that was transformed by adenovirus type 5. The PER.C6 cell line was developed in 1995 from retinal tissue from an abortion in 1985 that was transformed by adenovirus type 5. The University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ChAdOX1 nCoV-19 is developed in the HEK 293 cell line and the Janssen/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson vaccine Adenovirus 26 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S is developed in the PER.C6 cell line; however, the final products do not contain fetal cells. The mRNA vaccines are not manufactured in cell lines, although testing of mRNA vaccines reportedly uses cell lines.Bioethicist Robert Orr MD suggested criteria for evaluating moral complicity: (1) timing, (2) proximity, (3) certitude, (4) knowledge and (5) intent . (1) Facilitating a future immoral act is clearly problematic whereas indirect association with a completed, past action may be unavoidable. For example, driving on a road that was originally built with slave labor may be difficult to avoid in some places. The abortions resulting in these cell lines occurred in the 1970s and 1980s are separate in time, intent and deed from vaccination today. (2) Proximity deals with the closeness of persons with the action. For instance, a school is not responsible for teaching chemistry that a graduate used in planning a bombing; it is the graduate who is responsible for such an evil action. Although the original cell that resulted in the cell line was derived from an abortion, the current cell lines have multiplied many times &#x02013; it is not the original tissue. Indeed, vaccination today is remote in intent and deed from cell strain establishment and from abortion that occurred more than a quarter century ago. (3) Certitude deals with how well the facts are known. First, the facts related to cell lines are fairly well established. Second, for public health, the CDC ACIP Evidence to Recommendation Framework specifically addresses certainty of the evidence for critical outcomes  and has found high certainty for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19. (4) Knowledge of the moral issue is the next criterion. Many car drivers in the southern part of the US do not know if some of the roads that they use were originally made with slave labor over a hundred and fifty years ago. In an analogous manner, a person who is vaccinated today would not be accountable for detailed knowledge of circumstances of a quarter or half century ago, before many of the vaccinees were even born. (5) Intent is the final criterion. The intent of the development of COVID-19 vaccines is to protect the vaccinee, protect the population and control the pandemic. For those with a prolife viewpoint, Dr. Orr notes: &#x0201c;It might be possible to remove any concern about moral complicity in those situations where there is a clear separation between the intention of the immoral act of person A and the intention of person B. For example, in the vaccine example, the intention of person A was to end a pregnancy, not to develop a vaccine. Development of the vaccine by person C was a noble act that happened to be possible because of the earlier immoral act of person A. Thus, use of the vaccine by person B is clearly separated from the immoral act, so that person B should bear no moral culpability&#x0201d; .\n\nThe Principle of Double Effect is used to evaluate moral conflicts when an action could produce both good and bad effects. These criteria include: (1) the action itself must be morally indifferent or good, (2) the bad effect must not be the means by which the good effect is achieved, (3) the motive must be the achievement of the good effect only, and (4) the good effect must be at least equivalent in importance to the bad effect . To apply these criteria to COVID 19 vaccination: (1) the act of vaccination is good as it prevents disease in the recipient and contributes to herd immunity. (2) The aforementioned abortions were independent events performed decades ago for purposes other than vaccination; the disease was not known to exist then. (3) The motive for vaccination is protection of the vaccinee and, secondarily, protection of their contacts and the community by herd immunity; thus, the motives are good. (4) The good effect, saving of hundreds of thousands of lives in this circumstance, is clearly greater than the bad effect. For reference, as of this publication, greater than 5989,000 persons have died due to COVID-19 in the US.Vaccination is a priority because it reduces viral transmission , thereby protecting others. COVID-19 is highly transmissible person-to-person, including asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic persons . Indeed, 44% of secondary cases are infected during the pre-symptomatic stage , before a primary case would know to isolate to protect others. Furthermore, at least a third of cases are from asymptomatic spread, in which case no extra isolation measures could be planned . Thus, given that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission reduces the potential for symptomatic-based prevention measures such as isolation, another strategy is needed out of concern for others. Vaccination reduces not only symptomatic infection, but asymptomatic infection and transmission as well.\n\nHerd immunity can protect vulnerable persons, such as those with immunocompromising conditions or the very aged, who may not respond as well to vaccination or persons with allergic conditions that preclude vaccination. To achieve herd immunity, contacts of the vulnerable, in particular, and the general population at large need to be vaccinated. Israel, among the first countries to see high vaccination rates against COVID-19, has seen a drop in cases that can be attributed to herd immunity . Vaccination with the purpose to achieve herd immunity and protect others is altruistic.Religious texts support prevention and altruism. In the context of the ancient Middle East, during which time people spent time on their roof, it is written &#x0201c;When you build a new house, be sure to put a railing around the edge of the roof. Then you will not be responsible if someone falls off and is killed&#x0201d; (Deuteronomy 22:8, Good News Translation (GNT)). Physical protection, even with human-made instruments, is seen as a blessing: &#x0201c;May his towns be protected with iron gates&#x0201d; (Deuteronomy 33:25, GNT). The &#x0201c;Love one another&#x0201d; passages in the New Testament support caring for another, with direct attention to caring for physical needs: &#x0201c;&#x02026;our love should not be just words &#x02026; shows itself in action.&#x0201d; (1 John 3:18 GNT). Being vaccinated dramatically reduces the risk that one will transmit virus to others.\n\nA number of religious leaders from a variety of faiths have spoken in favor of vaccination &#x02013; see  .Table 1\n\nSampling of quotes or notes by religious leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination.JudaismThree of the most senior rabbis in ultra-Orthodox Judaism -- Chaim Kanievsky, Gershon Edelstein, and Shalom Cohen -- recommended recently that &#x0201c;anyone who has the option of getting the vaccine should get it.&#x0201d;Protestant Christianity&#x0201c;And I think when trusted religious voices can help people accept that the vaccine is a good and godly thing to do, that helps reach people who might not trust it from other voices in the community.&#x02019; Bishop Scott Jones, United Methodist Church.Catholic Christianity&#x0201c;It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process. Due to the situation of the ongoing pandemic, &#x0201c;all vaccinations recognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience with the certain knowledge that the use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells used in production of the vaccines derive.&#x0201d;\r\nThe Vatican&#x02019;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.IslamSo on March 18, Hassan and 15 other imams from around Minnesota gathered at a local health care clinic in Minneapolis. Not only did they get vaccinated against a virus that wracked their community; they did so on camera, in front of multiple Somali-language media outlets to make their message loud and clear. Imam Hassan Ali Mohamud thought of a passage from the Qur&#x02019;an.&#x000a0;Saving one person&#x02019;s life is equal to saving all of humanity, according to the often cited passage. Which means it&#x02019;s fairly easy to argue that receiving the vaccine is a religious duty, Hassan said.Evangelical Christianity&#x0201c;Indeed, the vaccines are a cause for Christians to rejoice and to give glory to God. The Bible, after all, speaks of medicine as a common grace, discovered by human beings but given by God&#x02026;By getting vaccinated as soon as our time is called, we can actively work for what we have been praying for &#x02014; churches filled with people, hugs in the church foyer, and singing loudly together the hymns we love.&#x0201d; Russell Moore and Walter Kim (National Association of Evangelicals)HinduIn January, Swayamprakash Swami,&#x02026; a senior monk affiliated with&#x000a0;BAPS, a mainstream Hindu denomination, gave his blessing to the Covid-19 shots. The ancient&#x000a0;Hindu&#x000a0;principle of ahimsa, an exhortation to do no harm and revere life, is being used to encourage Hindus in North America to embrace the vaccine, said Dr. Kashyap Patel, a cardiologist in Atlanta who is a medical adviser to BAPS.Orthodox ChristianityFather Paul Abernathy, pastor of St. Moses the Black Orthodox Church, worked on training of community liaisons to serve as &#x0201c;living, breathing, walking ambassadors of the vaccine.&#x0201d;Mormonism&#x0201c;The church urges its members, employees and missionaries to be good global citizens and help quell the pandemic by safeguarding themselves and others through immunization&#x0201d;\n\nLinks accessed in May or June 2021.For those patients who refuse a vaccine that is developed in a cell line that was derived from an abortion, alternatives exist: for instance, mRNA vaccines as a class are not designed, developed or produced in fetal cell lines . In addition to the mRNA vaccines, other classes are in development with products not designed or produced in fetal cell lines.\n\nAs a note to manufacturers, vaccine designers and policy officials, development of vaccines in cell lines that are not derived from abortion is feasible, eliminates this controversy, may increase vaccination rates and may result in higher sales. For these reasons, I recommend use of uncontroversial cell lines.\n\nIn conclusion, I have provided four different responses that a clinician can use with those patients who have ethical concerns about certain COVID-19 vaccines that were developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life.\n\nThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dr. Zimmerman has a pending grant with Sanofi Pasteur on an unrelated topic.1.

Hard-hit northeastern states have reported decreases in new cases in recent days, and the pace of deaths nationwide has fallen.\n\nThe daily death toll in New York, the hardest-hit state, .\n\nBut persistently high numbers of cases remain in a number of cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. Cases have been rising in Arkansas, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\n\nMost  and , including Dr. Anthony S.

People who haven‚Äôt been tested are dying at home and at nursing homes, and early this year some coronavirus deaths were probably misidentified.\n\nThe Times counted cases and deaths that have been identified by officials as probable coronavirus patients. Many states and counties only count cases and deaths in which an infection was confirmed through testing.\n\nBecause confirmed cases are widely considered to be  of the true toll, some state and local governments have started identifying probable cases and deaths.\n\nThe milestone comes amid debate over the timeliness of the nation‚Äôs response to the pandemic, with one Columbia University model showing that about  if the United States had acted earlier.Image A transmission electron microscopic image of coronaviruses, in blue, from the first case of Covid-19 in the United States.

The  may clarify nagging ambiguities about the arrival of the pandemic, Carl Zimmer reports.\n\nFor example, while President Trump has frequently claimed that a ban on travelers from China prevented the outbreak from becoming much worse, the new data suggest that the virus that started Washington State‚Äôs epidemic arrived about two weeks after the ban was imposed on Feb. 2.\n\nAnd the authors argue that the relatively late emergence of the outbreak means that more lives could have been saved by early action, such as testing and contact tracing.\n\nThe new analysis is not the last word. Scientific understanding of the virus is evolving almost daily, and this type of research yields a range of possible results, not complete certainty.Many infections in Washington State seem to have occurred earlier in February, and other models suggested that the epidemic there began before the middle of the month.\n\nBut a number of virus experts said that the new report convincingly ruled out a connection between the first confirmed cases and the later outbreaks.\n\n‚ÄúThis paper clearly shows this didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù said Kristian Andersen, a computational biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, who was not involved in the research.Image Downtown Los Angeles this month.

They also were more likely to work in industries where job losses have been particularly severe.\n\nMany have been scraping by because of temporary government assistance and emergency orders that put many evictions on hold. But evictions will soon be allowed in about half of the states, according to Emily A. Benfer, a housing expert and associate professor at Columbia Law School who is tracking eviction policies.\n\n‚ÄúI think we will enter into a severe renter crisis, and very quickly,‚Äù Professor Benfer said. Without a new round of government intervention, she added, ‚Äúwe will have an avalanche of evictions across the country.‚Äù\n\nThat means more and more families may soon face displacement at a time when people are still being urged to stay at home.\n\nIn many places, that has already begun.

The virus affects everyone.‚Äù\n\nA range of education officials said the guidance would divert millions of dollars from disadvantaged students and force districts to support even the wealthiest private schools.\n\nThe association representing the nation‚Äôs school superintendents told districts to ignore the guidance, and at least two states, Indiana and Maine, said they would.\n\nPrivate school leaders say they are also in crisis. Many of those schools serve low-income students whose parents have fled failing public schools. About 5.7 million students attend private schools, 30 percent of them from families with incomes below $75,000 a year. Private school groups say those families are most at risk without federal aid.\n\nUnder federal education law, school districts are required to use funding they receive for their poorest students to provide ‚Äúequitable services,‚Äù such as tutoring and transportation for low-income students attending private schools in their districts. But Ms. DeVos‚Äôs guidance would award private schools more services than the law would normally require.\n\nLast week, , including Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said Ms. DeVos‚Äôs interpretation was flawed.\n\nDemocratic leaders called on Ms. DeVos to revise her guidance.Image A funeral for Bessie Lacoste at Green Street Cemetery in New Orleans this month involved FaceTiming relatives.

Annie Flanagan for The New York Times  Yet another medical study, this one by doctors at a large hospital system based in New Orleans, has called attention to the disproportionate burden the pandemic is taking on communities of color.\n\nThough the hospital system, Ochsner Health, serves a predominantly white population, most patients hospitalized with Covid-19 over a recent six-week period were black, according to research published on Wednesday in .\n\nOchsner Health operates hospitals and outpatient facilities throughout Louisiana. About 30 percent of the patient population is black. Among the 1,382 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from March 1 to April 11, however, 77 percent were black.\n\nBlack patients made up 80 percent of patients transferred to the intensive care unit and nearly 82 percent of those put on ventilators to help with breathing.\n\nBlack patients accounted for 70.6 percent of the 326 hospital patients who died.\n\nThe authors of the new study reported that compared with white patients who were hospitalized, black patients had higher rates of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease, all of which have been linked to worse outcomes in patients with Covid-19.Image Protesters in Minneapolis on Tuesday after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died while in police custody.

But the group as a whole seemed to send a message that their desire for justice had outweighed safety concerns as they gathered at the intersection where Mr. Floyd, 46, had been pinned down by the police a day earlier and captured on video saying, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù\n\nAs protesters yelled about Mr. Floyd‚Äôs death, some pulled their masks aside to be fully heard. One woman said, ‚Äúanyone worried about social distancing should have just stayed home.‚ÄùImage An empty Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Fla.  Credit...

Two of Disney World‚Äôs four main theme parks, the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom, will reopen on July 11 with reduced capacity and numerous safety precautions, including mandatory face masks for all visitors and employees. The remaining major parks, Epcot and Hollywood Studios, will reopen on July 15.

All visitors will need a reservation. Temperature checks will be conducted at entrances. Disney also said its parades, fireworks displays and character meet-and-greets would be suspended because of crowd control concerns.Image Trading on Wall Street reflected optimism about a return to normal as states and national governments lift stay-at-home restrictions.

And we‚Äôll even do it greater, so we‚Äôll leave a little extra distance.‚Äù\n\nThis week, though, the lawmakers asked the administration to shelve any plans entirely. The Washington area has struggled to contain the virus, and the lawmakers warned that holding a mass gathering along the National Mall would be perilous.\n\nThousands of people attended a ‚Äú‚Äù event last year, which Mr. Trump had pledged would be a ‚Äúshow of a lifetime.‚Äù The president was flanked by Bradley armored vehicles and M1A2 tanks at the event, held at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n‚ÄúThe administration, including your agencies, should be focusing on helping American families, not on a vanity project for the president,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote.\n\nFrance revoked the authorization allowing the use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 patients on Wednesday, a day after halting its use in clinical trials.\n\nThe drug, which has been heavily promoted by President Trump despite the lack of evidence that it is effective against the virus, was temporarily removed from global safety trials earlier this week by the World Health Organization, which called for a review of new safety concerns.\n\nAll this time with your family may have led to greater feelings of connectedness.

They also allegedly love to run parent-teacher associations so they can impose their views on both their children and school staff.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the term was extended to ‚ÄòCoronavirus Karen‚Äô ‚Äì the kind of woman who refuses to wear a mask in shops.\n\nLast year, the pizza delivery company Domino‚Äôs offered Karens in New Zealand the chance to win a free pizza ‚Äòas a break from negativity‚Äô.

I noticed some memes on TikTok and it was quite funny to begin with. But when the Black Lives Matter protests started and there was a lot of media saying Karens were racist, it took on a life of it‚Äôs own.\n\nI feel we cant, as Karens, can‚Äôt talk about how this is affecting us, because then we are entitled if we do this. So I set up a Change.org to say this is not fair, us having to put up with this.\n\nWe are labelled as racist and entitled and we are just not that sort of person, and we want the media to stop using our name to describe racist people.

According to Paul Dickson, the author of ‚ÄúThe New Dickson Baseball Dictionary,‚Äù the term bullpen was first cited in 1915 in an issue of Baseball Magazine. At the turn of the century, he wrote, ‚Äúnearly every ballpark in the country featured a Bull Durham tobacco sign ‚Äî a giant bull-shaped billboard ‚Äî affixed to the outfield wall.‚Äù He claimed, ‚ÄúAll the games were played during the day, and relievers warmed up in the shadow of the bull. Over time, that area became known as the bullpen.‚Äù¬†\n\nOthers disagree. In the same , Steve Perrault of Merriam-Webster said, ‚Äú‚ÄòBullpen‚Äô is almost always used metaphorically, not in reference to a pen for male cows.‚Äù John Thorn, editor of Total Baseball, argued that Dickson‚Äôs claim wasn‚Äôt true: ‚Äú‚Äòbullpen‚Äô was in use as early as 1870. It referred to the roped-off area in foul territory from where late arriving fans could watch the game.‚Äù In a  he wrote:¬† \n\nThis simile no doubt has its basis in two earlier usages of the word bullpen ‚Äî as a prison enclosure, primarily an open-air improvised demarcation; and as a ‚Äòschoolboys‚Äô ball game, played by two groups, one group outlining the sides of a square enclosure, called the bullpen, within which are the opposing players‚Äô (The Oxford English Dictionary). The ball game, popular on the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìKentucky frontier of the 1850s, is first men¬≠tioned in print in Edward Eggleston‚Äôs homespun classic The Hoosier Schoolmaster (1871): ‚ÄòHe could not throw well enough to make his mark in that famous Western game of bull-pen.‚Äô Both senses of the word ‚Äî the prison enclosure and the ball game ‚Äî imply enforced occupancy in the bullpen, which reflects the status of the substitute pitcher in the pre-relief era.\n\nMLB has not responded yet, but some baseball players and teams have  with jokes and ridicule: No more dugouts then will refer to them as ‚ÄúChute 1 &amp; Chute 2‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Taylor Hearn (@thearn14)\n\n I can‚Äôt roll my eyes hard enough‚Ä¶. üôÑ\n\n‚Äî Travis Shaw (@travis_shaw21)\n\n But they are cool with the abuse ‚Äúbats‚Äù take? üßê\n\n‚Äî Chris Iannetta (@Chris_Iannetta)\n\n \n\n‚Äî Portland Pickles (@picklesbaseball)\n\n  Sources:¬†\n\nDefinition of SPECIESISM. https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/speciesism.

The brand has already been selling wedding T-shirts as part of this love fest, so perhaps its latest fashion extension -- outdoorsy wedding dresses available through a tie-in with David&rsquo;s Bridal -- should come as no surprise.\n\n(Note to fashionistas for whom, yes, the whole idea might be a shocking surprise -- check out the image above. Might not be your choice, but the print looks fairly tasteful, all in all.)\n\nThe custom $799 dress (on sale for $749 through Monday), features subtle Busch branding and is available online from David&rsquo;s through Black Friday, Nov. 26, in either gray camo or green camo. The colors and pattern are derived from Busch&rsquo;s camo cans, first offered in 2006 and now available again to coincide with the dress&rsquo;s availability, said Daniel Blake, group vice president, Budweiser &amp; Value, Anheuser-Busch.advertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nBrides needn&rsquo;t worry about standing alone, either. David&rsquo;s is also offering a matching $14.95 men&rsquo;s bow tie, and the retailer&rsquo;s social content &ldquo;will feature ways to pair the dress with bridesmaids&rsquo; colors,&rdquo; Laura McKeever, senior manager of public relations and communications at David&rsquo;s, told Marketing Daily.\n\n&ldquo;This dress is, of course, for a more nontraditional bride,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;definitely one who loves the outdoors, and outdoor weddings are even more popular now than ever before. This is perfect for a bride who wants something different or perhaps a second dress for her event to surprise her groom.\"\n\n&ldquo;Our fans believe everything is better outside,&rdquo; explained Blake. &ldquo;Busch Light has long been a staple at [their] weddings, so why not make experiences tailored to them?&rdquo;\n\nBut the dress isn&rsquo;t limited to weddings, McKeever said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are marketing this not just as a wedding dress, but for any occasion. We purposely selected a gown design -- one of our most beloved satin ball gown -- 5hat is bridal, but lends itself to an occasion-dress option as well.&rdquo;\n\nPotential buyers are invited to check their fit by trying on style V3848 (which retails for $699) in David&rsquo;s stores nationwide.\n\nMarketing for the camo dress, concentrated on social and digital PR, will include a Nov. 2-5 sweepstakes, with one dress as the prize. Anyone 21 or older will be able to enter by following the Instagram feeds of both David&rsquo;s Bridal and Busch Beer and also liking or commenting on the David&rsquo;s sweepstakes announcement post.\n\nFor Busch Light, the dress is a way to &ldquo;return the favor&rdquo; of its fans &ldquo;making our beer an honored guest&rdquo; at their nuptials, said Blake.\n\n&ldquo;Couples love to serve it [Busch] at their weddings, we hear,&rdquo; commented McKeever. &ldquo;Busch approached us with this idea, and it was just too fun and unexpected for us to turn down. Our team was so excited about thinking outside the box and figuring out how we could make camo work for a wedding dress.&rdquo;,                                              ,                                              ,                                              ,                                              Comment                             Next story loading UPCOMING EVENTS&nbsp;\n\nadvertisementMore from Marketing DailySPONSORED CONTENT', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/camouflage-wedding-dress/'),

yesterday. While the country is still recovering from the post-Diwali hangover, ¬†shared a throwback picture this morning, demonstrating how our country looks from space in the night when we light the diyas (earthen lamps). As per NASAs description, the image was snapped in 2012 by¬†the¬†Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite¬†(VIIRS) camera equipped on the¬†Suomi NPP¬†satellite, offering a stunning view of the South-Eastern nation.\n\nIn a picture posted by NASA History Office, it revealed the details of the image taken in infrared on the night of November 12, 2012.¬†      \n\nHappy !\r\n  \r\n  This photo was taken by s Suomi NPP satellite on Diwali in 2012, capturing an infrared view of South Asia on the evening of the holiday.\r\n  \r\n  Learn more about how this image was taken:    ‚Äî NASA History Office (@NASAhistory)\n\nAs the VIIRS cameras full name suggests, it captured the image in infrared during the night. According to NASA,¬†the image is based on data collected by the VIIRS ‚Äúday-night band‚Äù, which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared. Since there is no shortage of multicoloured light during Diwali, the camera was easily able to pick up the lights having longer wavelengths. However,¬†the image has been brightened to make the city lights easier to distinguish, says NASA.¬†READ |\n\nThis majestic image should not be mistaken for the one that circulates on social media every Diwali. For those brainstorming to remember¬†the fake picture, take a look at the example below.¬†READ |       \n\nDiwali is incomplete without sharing this picture of India shared by NASA.   ‚Äî Rahul Tewari‚ö° (@ImRa_hulT)\n\nThe above image has nothing to do with the festival of lights, rather it¬†is a colour-composite image created in 2003 by NOAA scientist Chris Elvidge to highlight population growth over time. White areas in the image¬†show city lights that were visible prior to 1992, while blue, green, and red shades indicate city lights that became visible in 1992, 1998, and 2003 respectively.¬†READ |\n\nBut the agency did make the Indians happy as it shared another glittering picture of the universe and wished \"all those who celebrate\".      \n\n‚ú® Happy  to all who celebrate!

She‚Äôs at home among the Maya stone sculptures, Pueblo pottery, Yokuts ceremonial basketry, and Yup‚Äôik walrus tusk and whale bone carvings that make up the de Young Museum‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt of the Americas‚Äù wing. The rooms are cast in soft, dispersed light to protect the photosensitive pieces, reverential lighting that is usually reserved for cathedrals or icons. It feels both deliberate and apt. The gentle shafts of light impress upon visitors the sanctity of the pieces.\n\nNampeyo of Hano, a Hopi-Tewa artisan, is the grande dame of Hopi pottery, with a legacy almost unparalleled in Native circles. At ‚ÄúNampeyo and the Siky√°tki Revival,‚Äù the exhibition‚Äôs layout emphasizes the central role of her work in the history of Native American art. Her vessels sit on two pedestals in the center of the space surrounded by work she borrowed from and work by contemporary artists who borrow from her. There‚Äôs no cut-and-dry chronology to the pieces collected, no historical procession. In its place, co-curators Bobby Silas and Hillary Olcott host a quiet conversation between past and present, between ancestral Hopi potters and contemporary artists like Steve Lucas and Les Namingha, both of whom just happen to be Nampeyo‚Äôs great-great-grandsons.¬†¬†   Subscribe to our weekly arts &amp; culture newsletter    	 		Subscribe\n\n 				By clicking submit, you agree to share your email address with the site owner and Mailchimp to receive marketing, updates, and other emails from the site owner.

Some date as far back as the 14th century ‚Äî 200 years before Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, the first European to beach the continent, washed up on Florida‚Äôs shores, and more than 500 years before settlers built the first permanent structures in present-day Flagstaff, Arizona, only two hours outside of today‚Äôs Hopi Reservation. In the meantime, Hopi safeguarded 20-odd generations of tradition, some of which is now available for viewing at one of America‚Äôs premier art museums.¬†\n\nThere‚Äôs a pared-down beauty to the vessels¬†on display: the technique, the careful hand, the balanced compositions. As gorgeous as they are, though, these objects originally served a functional purpose ‚Äî storage ‚Äî and only incidentally acted as art objects¬†(if such a distinction can be made). The chipped mouth of one shallow, beige bowl (circa 1900), worn down by years of affectionate use, reminds the viewer that this was once a household utensil, possibly an heirloom.¬†¬†    Nampeyo didn‚Äôt have the same resources today‚Äôs potters do when she was crafting her earthenware around the turn of the 20th century. (Photo courtesy the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco)\n\nA brief note on her methods. Nampeyo didn‚Äôt have a wheel to throw her clay or an air-conditioned studio in which to work ‚Äî much less a supply store from which she could purchase materials. No, each piece was borne of hard labor and inherited know-how. First, Mesa Hopi lacked running water, so Nampeyo carried the precious resource over miles of arid, searing terrain to hydrate the clay-rich soils she coiled into vessels by hand, massaging the sunbaked clay into a malleable consistency. A kiln was constructed out of stones and kindled with sheep manure, wood and black coal ‚Äî a firing technique learned from Spanish ceramicists who settled in the region. In addition to reaching higher temperatures, the Spanish method ‚Äî which sometimes called for sheep bones ‚Äî offered the added benefit of further whitening the pottery, allowing painted colors to really pop. Nampeyo‚Äôs pigments derived from the earth: yellow ochre, red iron oxide and black hematite and boiled beeweed. Beginning to end, a finished product could take multiple days to produce.¬†¬†\n\nBut¬†what¬†can be said of¬†the woman behind the¬†work?¬†¬†\n\nSometimes very little. It‚Äôs difficult to pin down even basic biographical information (i.e. the precise year she was born) or verify much of what Nampeyo said. Some of what‚Äôs written about her has the uncanny air of invention because anthropologists and art collectors mediated her image to the world. From what is known, she cuts a humble figure, acquiescing to outsiders‚Äô photographs but never leaving a signature on her earthenware. Each work is ‚ÄúAttributed to Nampeyo,‚Äù the captions read, by art historians and collectors familiar with her style. Credit for her virtuosity arrives late to the scene. Meanwhile, most photographs of her were captured as archival material by ethnographers who staged her to look diminutive among her wares. The implication being that ‚Äúthe work drowned the artist‚Äù when, in reality, the opposite was true. She was a prolific artist with a careful control of her medium.  Hopi-Tewa potter Nampeyo builds a kiln circa 1906. (Edward S. Curtis/Library of Congress via Bay City News)\n\n‚ÄúTraditional‚Äù works like Nampeyo‚Äôs aren‚Äôt simply a gift from the past, they‚Äôre often a negotiation between recovered style and contemporary art practice. Nampeyo was born in Hano Pueblo in present-day Arizona around 1860. She was in her mid-30s when the anthropologist Jesse Walter Fewkes led a Smithsonian-funded excavation of Siky√°tki, a former Hopi village on First Mesa, which had been abandoned by its inhabitants in the 17th century. The excavation began in earnest in 1895, and soon Fewkes unearthed numerous, well-preserved ceramics of Hopi origin.\n\nAlready a skilled artisan by then, Nampeyo learned to paint from these shards and, in borrowing from the recovered artifacts, developed what would come to be known as ‚ÄúSiky√°tki Revival style.‚Äù She spent the next decades working within its strictures, building a number of unique aesthetic markers. Her signature ‚Äúsaucer‚Äù shape blended form and function: The  prevented rodents from climbing into the vessels and spoiling the food stored inside. (Such utility is what sets pottery apart from other art forms.) Perhaps the most famous of her motifs is the avian ‚Äú,‚Äù which narrates the diaspora of Hopi across the continent, over land and lake.¬†\n\nThough the meaning behind the imagery is admittedly ‚Äúdifficult to understand at first glance,‚Äù according to one caption, the illustrations can be understood as a ‚Äúpermanent prayer‚Äù for rain and bountiful harvests.¬†¬†    Nampeyo, a noted Hopi-Tewa potter of the Hano pueblo in northeastern Arizona, decorates pottery circa 1903. (Homer E. Sargent Jr./Library of Congress via Bay City News)\n\nI recently spoke about Nampeyo with Gerald Clarke, a Cahuilla multimedia artist and professor of ethnic studies who teaches at the University of California, Riverside. Clarke explained that Nampeyo served as a bellwether for the future of Native American cultural production. By the turn of the 20th century, just before she lost her eyesight to trachoma, a preventable infection that hardens the cornea, her work in ceramics established the aesthetic standard for Native American pottery and ceramic wares, a standard that holds to this day. Her Siky√°tki Revival style is ‚Äústill the standard that non-Native collectors desire,‚Äù Clarke told me, and, consequently, what many Native American artists produce.\n\nNative American art, he went on, ‚Äúhas evolved over the past century from being categorized as ethnographic artifact (sometime oddity)‚Äù to being treated ‚Äúas [a] tourist trinket, and only recently as art or fine art.‚Äù Out of this progression grew a wider acknowledgement of the influence of Native American art traditions on some of America‚Äôs most famous artists. It has been suggested, for instance, that Jackson Pollock‚Äôs ‚Äúdrip period‚Äù borrowed technique and choreography from Navajo sand painting. Likewise, Dale Chihuly mimicked designs for his glass ‚Äú‚Äù series directly from his personal collection of weaving and basketry by Native American artists from the Pacific Northwest. Still, Nampeyo‚Äôs influence outside the Native art world remains ‚Äúminimal,‚Äù according to Clarke.\n\nWhen I asked him how he thought Nampeyo has been covered in art history, he pointed to a conspicuous lack of analysis around the context of her art practice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much easier to appreciate the aesthetic object rather than acknowledge that it was America‚Äôs own hunger for land, resources and ethnocentric biases that ‚Äòshaped‚Äô Nampeyo‚Äôs work.‚Äù\n\nHe‚Äôs right. Few writings on the Hopi ceramicist‚Äôs masterpieces delve into the drastic changes visited on Native peoples in the late 19th and early 20th century. Indigenous resistance to the 1887 Dawes Allotment Act, which accelerated the theft of tribal landholdings, exhausted already-scarce resources in Native communities. This was also the era of the American Indian , which harmed generations of families and depleted hope for reconciliation. Yet the Hopi never relented. At stake for the Nation was a communal way of life with its matriarchs at the helm. In 1894, leaders and chiefs submitted a petition to Washington demanding their traditions be respected and sovereignty upheld.¬†¬†  Hopi-Tewa potter Nampeyo paints designs on pottery circa 1900. (Edward S. Curtis/Library of Congress via Bay City News)\n\nThings weren‚Äôt much better in the art world. Indian art galleries were managed by , and consequently, Native art began to revolve around the tastes of non-Native collectors. The skew notwithstanding, Nampeyo lucked out. Fewkes and collectors alike nurtured a cult of personality around her for their own benefit, but it catapulted her work to national attention.¬†¬†\n\nIn this tricky art market, Nampeyo ran a clever gambit, calculating that if her work stuck to a certain aesthetic mode she could turn the power dynamic in her favor. It worked. Collectors who prized her pottery for its acumen and finesse paid handsomely, and her ceramics secured a steady income for her family at a time when U.S. theft of Hopi land reduced many of its citizens to destitution.\n\nOn the downside, however, to cultivate marketable mystique around the objects they collected, some traders and ethnographers were in the habit of characterizing Native artists in derogatory, racist terms, particularly when it came to  whose prowess in their craft exceeded ordinary finesse and breached the hallowed grounds of fine art.\n\nOf course, Nampeyo transcended those abusive labels. She was an artisan, an artist who tested the limits of her medium and mined inspiration from clay shards strewn across Hopi soil. The land was both teacher and wellspring of inspiration. Perhaps this is why her pottery feels as if it has been plucked from the earth fully formed.¬†¬†¬†    Nampeyo‚Äôs work is at the center of the de Young exhbition, ‚ÄúNampeyo and the Siky√°tki Revival.‚Äù (Photo courtesy the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco)\n\nClarke‚Äôs insight into the political context of Nampeyo‚Äôs ceramics extends right up until today with an equally electric charge.¬†¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to gaze at the collected water jars (circa 1890) adorned with oily black eagle wings without considering the status of fresh water in Native America today. Many in the Hopi Nation lack running water, and Natives number disproportionately among the  Americans without complete plumbing and sewer systems. Figures from water-stressed regions of North America are particularly troubling. According to a report by the , ‚ÄúNearly three-quarters of households in an area of northern Arizona that includes five Native reservations lack connected plumbing.‚Äù As in the 1890s, so too today.¬†¬†\n\nYet Native Americans are fighting for their land, their sovereignty and their right to stewardship. In the past few months, Native water protectors, along with their allies in the ‚Äú‚Äù campaign, have worked to block the construction of a pipeline in Minnesota that would carry nearly a million barrels of  from Alberta, Canada, to Superior, Wisconsin, every day. The Ojibwe environmental activist and economist  has characterized the pipeline as ‚Äúa crime against the environment and Indigenous rights.‚Äù (Bitumen-rich tar sands are petroleum‚Äôs dirtier cousin, partly because they‚Äôre  than conventional crude.) First Nations peoples in Canada (i.e. Wet‚Äôsuwet‚Äôen, Elsipogtog and Mi‚Äôkmaq) and Native Americans (i.e. the Standing Rock Sioux, Navajo and Gwich ºin) have been locked in similar battles with the petrochemical industry over proposed oil prospecting for years.\n\nIt was this spirit of pride and principled rebellion that Clarke referenced when I asked him how Nampeyo has influenced his practice as a Native American artist.¬†\n\n‚ÄúWhile I love the harmonious forms and complex designs of her work,‚Äù Clark¬†wrote me, ‚Äúit is her dedication to family and community that inspires me. She managed to create such beauty¬†in spite of¬†the social/political context of the time. Nampeyo‚Äôs work is an expression of resilience, perseverance and resistance.‚Äù¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúNampeyo and the Siky√°tki Revival‚Äù shows at the de Young Museum until Feb. 26, 2023.

A little over a month later, Covid-19 is under control in Japan.    	\n\nPublished: November 3, 2021, 4:21 pm 			   Read more Dr. Haruo Ozaki, chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association had held an emergency press conference on August 13, announcing some 18000 new infections daily. However, the death count has eased as compared to previous surges.¬†In an interview with the The Yomiuri Shimbun¬†on August 5, Ozaki spoke in detail about his opinion that Ivermectin should be used in Japan and said that his early calls for usage had seemingly not been heeded.\n\nJapan had slavishly adhered to all the Big Pharma prescriptions, including quarantine, contact tracing, masking, social distance, but finally the pandemic had hit them hard after they started aggressive vaccination in May 2021. The results looked good initially, but in mid July they started rising again and on August 6 cases hit a new all time high and continued to rise.\n\nIvermectin was allowed as a treatment on August 13 and after 2 weeks the cases started to . In fact, they are now down 99 percent from the peak.\n\nSince April 28, India medical officials started providing hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin to its massive population. As India is the major pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world, they are naturally geared for mass drug distribution.\n\nMuch like the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, parts of Bangladesh, and places like Argentina and Mexico, Ozaki had called for the immediate release of Ivermectin in Japan. Ivermectin is legal in Japan\n\nIn Japan, doctors can now prescribe it without restrictions, and people can buy it legally from India. Japan is a country where 72,5 percent of the inhabitants are fully vaccinated.\n\nThe Japanese have meanwhile not bought into the notion of a third booster shot. Instead four local companies are currently carrying out clinical trials, but only one ‚Äì Daiichi Sankyo ‚Äì is developing a type of mRNA shot. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently the most commonly used in Japan, have many side effects, such as fevers and pain, according to national daily Mainichi.\n\nThey are also tricky to handle due to the need to store them at freezing temperatures and the nature of each vial containing multiple doses. A Shionogi official says the firm is working on a domestic product which will be able to be stored in a fridge, with one vial used per person.\n\nHydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were both FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria and parasitic ailments. Hydroxychloroquine is also approved to treat autoimmune conditions such as chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus in adults, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nBoth Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have been prescribed for years with . Notably, FDA-approved products may legally be prescribed by physicians for other uses, including for Covid-19 when deemed appropriate.\n\nA source close to the Japanese government emphasized: &#8220;Coronavirus vaccines still have much room for improvement, and it is possible there could be domestic ones with better qualities.&#8221;¬†Japan withdrew Moderna jabs after  were found in these vaccines. Three lots of Moderna vaccines were recalled in Japan for metal contamination, according to a report from RT. Evidence from Africa\n\nDr. Ozaki has cited evidence from African nations that have utilized Ivermectin to treat Covid-19. He stated: ‚ÄúIn Africa, if we compare countries distributing Ivermectin once a year with countries who do not give Ivermectin‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt give Ivermectin to prevent Covid but to prevent parasitic disease‚Ä¶ if we look at Covid numbers in countries that give Ivermectin, the number of cases is 134.4/100,000 and the number of deaths is 2.2/100 000.‚Äù\n\nOnly 2,5 percent of Africans have had two shots, while rich countries have locked down enough vaccines to immunize their populations twice or three times over and now are authorizing booster shots.¬†Japan has suffered fewer than 16 000 deaths so far, the lowest rate among the G-7 countries ‚Äî and nearly one-14th the deaths per capita of its G-7 partners.\n\nJapan‚Äôs cumulative Covid numbers, especially their mortality rates, have been significantly lower than most EU countries or the US. But it is much more likely due to some combination of  that also helps lower severe outcomes as well as Ivermectin.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Its gotten to the point where some folks might actually start seeing things that are just crazy. Of course, they might not be imagining it - there has been a lot going on in the world that is hard to believe. Now, there is a new a video that has some people sure theyre seeing things and others certain its real. So whats it of?  disappearing on TV.\n\nVideo shows the head of the Catholic Church honoring the victims of COVID-19 from his window in Vatican City. He turns around and then disappears. One person shared the footage with the caption, &quot;Nothing is real. Pope disappears .&quot;   \n\nAnother person was able to slow down the video and it really does seem to show the pontiff .   The clip has some people claiming the church has created a hologram of Pope Francis, while others think he is even more divine than expected. Of course, the most likely explanation is that its probably just a glitch in the filming or editing processes.\n\nPhoto: YouTube  Music, radio and podcasts, all free.

(AP)                   By  October 28, 2021        If Your Time is short         If you&rsquo;ve seen media reports or social media postings about beagle puppies and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s going on.\n\nRecent blog posts from a conservative watchdog group interested in animal research spending have prompted a wave of criticism aimed at the nation&rsquo;s top infectious diseases expert, with lawmakers writing him over allegations that his government agency funded research that put beagles through cruel experiments.&nbsp;\n\nThe group, the White Coat Waste Project, founded in 2013 by former Republican strategist Anthony Bellotti, has released  in recent months. The reports are based largely on public records and documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.&nbsp;\n\nCollectively, the posts accuse the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci directs, of allocating money for various studies that exposed beagles to harsh treatment, including sand fly bites, devocalization and euthanasia.&nbsp;\n\n&quot;Fauci wasted $1M+ to poison beagle puppies, cut out vocal cords,&quot; read the headline on , posted Oct. 5.\n\nConcern over the treatment of beagles in the studies has sparked blowback against Fauci from ,  like , and those who have been skeptical of Fauci since his support of mask wearing and other pandemic safety precautions.&nbsp;\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,  that Fauci and the NIAID were &quot;torturing puppies.&quot; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis  it &quot;disgusting&quot; and is emailing supporters a &quot;stand up to Fauci&quot; petition. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.,  that &quot;we should have de-barked Fauci.&quot; Donald Trump Jr. started  calling Fauci a &quot;puppy killer.&quot; And in a  led by Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., several lawmakers expressed &quot;grave concerns about reports of costly, cruel and unnecessary taxpayer-funded experiments on dogs commissioned by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&quot;\n\nBut amid the backlash, there&rsquo;s been some confusion about the studies covered by the White Coat Waste Project&rsquo;s allegations. Some reports and social media postings have jumbled details and conflated the different studies. Others have accused Fauci,&nbsp;who has not yet spoken publicly on the matter, of personal involvement.\n\nThe White Coat Waste Project told PolitiFact that it does not know if Fauci personally ordered the studies, but that &quot;it is 100% confirmed that Fauci&rsquo;s NIH division funded&quot; them. The NIAID, however, said one project &mdash; out of which came the widely circulated, graphic photo&nbsp;of beagles with their heads in mesh cages &mdash; was wrongly listed as receiving funding from the agency.&nbsp;\n\n&quot;All animals used in NIH-funded research are protected by laws, regulations, and policies to ensure the smallest possible number of subjects and the greatest commitment to their welfare,&quot; the agency said, adding that institutions that receive funds in the U.S. and abroad for animal research must abide by various rules and regulations.\n\nPolitiFact looked at all three blog posts the White Coat Waste Project published between July and October claiming that Fauci&rsquo;s division of the NIH, the NIAID, provided money to studies that ran tests on beagles, a popular small-to-mid-sized hound breed. Tunisia study\n\nWhat the White Coat Waste Project claimed:&nbsp;\n\nThe group alleged  an over $375,000 grant to a study in Tunisia that &quot;drug(ged) beagles and lock(ed) their heads in mesh cages filled with hundreds of infected sand flies,&quot; put them &quot;alone in cages in the desert overnight for nine consecutive nights to use them as bait to attract infectious sand flies,&quot; and  of both experiments.&nbsp;\n\nWhat PolitiFact found:&nbsp;\n\nThe NIAID rejected the White Coat Waste Project&rsquo;s claim that the agency provided money to the study in Tunisia that produced the widely circulated photo of beagles&rsquo; heads in mesh cages.\n\n&quot;The manuscript mistakenly cited support from NIAID, when in fact NIAID did not support this specific research shown in the images of the beagles being circulated,&quot; the agency said.&nbsp;\n\nThe journal that published the study, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, confirmed its mistake to . It also posted a  online, writing&nbsp;that the NIH &quot;did not provide any funding for this research and any such claim was made in error.&quot;\n\nThe NIAID said corrections will also be made to a database of NIH-funded research, which appeared to link the agency to the study and which the White Coat Waste Project cited.\n\nThis photo&nbsp;is&nbsp;from a study in Tunisia, published in&nbsp;PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, that erroneously listed the National Institutes of Health as a source of its funding.&nbsp;The journal has published a correction.\n\nThrough July 2021, the NIAID did fund a separate project in Tunisia to test a potential vaccine for leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies, the agency said. But the study involved immunizing 12 dogs and letting them roam around in an enclosed open space set up to mimic natural settings. The dogs were not sedated, trapped in cages, or fed to the flies. University of Georgia study\n\nWhat the White Coat Waste Project claimed:&nbsp;\n\nThe group alleged  more than $424,000 for a University of Georgia study &quot;in which healthy beagles are given an experimental drug and then intentionally infested with flies that carry a disease-causing parasite that affects humans.&quot; The group said some dogs &quot;vocalized in pain&quot; during the trial, and that they would be euthanized after the study.\n\nWhat PolitiFact found:&nbsp;\n\nThis study was designed to test a potential vaccine for a parasitic disease called lymphatic filariasis, which the  lists as the world&rsquo;s second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability in humans, the NIAID said.&nbsp;\n\nThe NIAID told PolitiFact that dogs were the best model for testing the vaccine because they are a natural host for the mosquito-transmitted parasite, and because they respond to the infections in a similar way to humans. In addition to protecting humans from the disease, a successful vaccine could also prevent filarial infections in dogs, the agency said.\n\nThe study began in November 2020 and is set to run through January 2022, according to the  the White Coat Waste Project shared with PolitiFact. PolitiFact asked the NIAID about the documents&rsquo; authenticity but did not hear back. They are redacted, but show 28 &quot;healthy, adult beagle dogs&quot; were used in the study, and that at certain points, dogs in one group &quot;vocalized in pain.&quot; At the end of the study, the dogs would be euthanized.&nbsp;\n\nLisa Moses, a veterinarian at Harvard Medical School&#39;s Center for Bioethics, told PolitiFact that such a practice is common at the end of research studies involving animals.\n\n&quot;Beagles are the standard dog model used in this type of research,&quot; added University of Georgia spokesperson Greg Trevor, in a statement to PolitiFact. &quot;Because this disease currently has no cure, unfortunately the animals that are part of this trial must be euthanized. We do not take lightly the decision to use such animals in some of our research.&quot;\n\nTrevor said the university has advanced several treatments over the years through the use of animal trials, including for cancers and infectious diseases like the Zika virus. SRI International study\n\nWhat the White Coat Waste Project claimed:&nbsp;\n\nThe group alleged  &quot;ordered cruel and unnecessary drug toxicity tests on dogs and other animals that cost taxpayers $1.68 million,&quot; meaning Fauci &quot;paid to poison puppies.&quot; The group claimed 44 beagles between 6 and 8 months old were injected with &quot;an experimental drug for weeks, and then killed and dissected,&quot; with some having their vocal cords cut.\r\n \r\n What PolitiFact found:&nbsp;\n\nThis study involved a contract with SRI International, a nonprofit research institute. MedPage Today  that &quot;Fauci himself did not sign off on the research contract.&quot;\n\nSRI International did not respond to a request for comment. But the NIAID said the tests were to assess the pharmacology and toxicology of potential therapeutics targeting HIV/AIDS, which lines up with the Washington Post&rsquo;s  about the purpose of the study.\n\n, obtained by the White Coat Waste Project via FOIA requests and shared with PolitiFact, show that the experiments involved 44 beagle puppies that were euthanized and had their vocal cords cut, a procedure called a cordectomy. The documents, which also have not been verified by the NIAID, said that &quot;every effort will be made to minimize, if not eliminate, pain and suffering in all animals in this study.&quot;\n\nThe NIAID said the testing was conducted &quot;as required in animal models by the FDA, in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice guidelines and in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care or its equivalent.&quot;\n\n&quot;Vocal cordectomies, conducted humanely under anesthesia, may be used in research facilities where numerous dogs are present,&quot; the agency added. &quot;This is to reduce noise, which is not only stressful to the animals but can also ... lead to hearing loss (in humans).&quot;\n\nThe American Veterinary Association  that such devocalization &quot;should not be used as an alternative to appropriate animal management and facility design&quot; in laboratory settings.

However, the Fake News Media is already trying to call it again for Biden before actually looking at the facts ‚Äî just like they did in November,\" Trump claimed in a statement via his Save America PAC newsletter. \"The audit has uncovered significant and undeniable evidence of FRAUD! Until we know how and why this happened, our Elections will never be secure.\"\n\n                                                         \n\nStatement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America ‚Äî RSBN üá∫üá∏ (@RSBNetwork)\n\nTrump released a second statement Friday morning alleging that election data from Maricopa County \"appears to have been intentionally deleted, and ballot images were corrupt or missing.\" The former president also cited figures he claimed demonstrated that there were \"enough fraudulent votes, mystery votes, and fake votes to change the outcome of the election 4 or 5 times over.\"\n\nLeaked draft reports from the hand count of 2.1 million ballots, which was commissioned by the majority-Republican Senate earlier this year, indicated that Trump had 261 fewer votes than the countys canvass gave him, while Biden evidently earned 99 more, according to preliminary report  by the Arizona Republic. Altogether, the election audit report suggested Biden gained 360 votes, scoring him a victory of 45,469 votes in Maricopa County, the report added.\n\nAccording to the preliminary summary report, which audit spokesman Randy Pullen contended is \"not the final report, but its close,\" to , auditors had several concerns after performing the monthslong election review, claiming that files were missing from the Election Management System server, data in the database related to the 2020 election had been fully cleared, and many people who had moved prior to the election cast ballots.\n\nTrumps chief spokeswoman Liz Harrington, who  a copy of the draft report, pointed to a line saying there was \"a total ballot delta of 11,592 between the official canvass and the VM55 file when considering both the counted and uncounted ballots\" as evidence the results should not have been certified.\n\n\"The official results vs. Maricopa Countys final records of who voted are off by 11,592, which is MORE than the election margin,\" she wrote. \"How can you certify results that the County cant even back up!\"                                                         \n\nI would remind Liz and everyone else there there is a thing called secured voters. They are federal judges law enforcement officers and domestic violence victims that do not show up on th vm55 voted file. ‚Äî The AZ - abc15 - Data Guru (@Garrett_Archer)\n\nHarringtons remark prompted pushback from election experts who also review the preliminary audit report, such as Garrett Archer, a former senior elections analyst for the Arizona Secretary of States Office who presently works as a political and data analyst for a local outlet ABC15.\n\n\"I would remind Liz and everyone else there there is a thing called secured voters,\" Archer tweeted. \"They are federal judges law enforcement officers and domestic violence victims that do not show up on th vm55 voted file.\"\n\nRepublican Senate President Karen Fann hired the Florida-based contractor Cyber Ninjas to lead the audit. The firm is operated by CEO Doug Logan, who has notoriously dodged media inquiries regarding the audit process since the recount  in late April.\n\nState Sen. Wendy Rogers, a Republican with connections to the audit effort, said she spoke with Logan on the phone and  the preliminary report was only a \"partial draft.\"\n\n\"Tomorrows hearing will render findings of great consequence,\" she added, implying that the preliminary report that was released to multiple media outlets is missing key details about the election review.\n\nBrnovichs office  the county to comply with a subpoena for router images the auditors claimed they needed to complete the report, or lose its state funding, which provides nearly a third of the countys budget. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors  with the Senate on Sept. 18 to establish a \"special master\" to take questions from Cyber Ninjas and another firm on the audit team, CyFIR, providing them with the information contained on the routers they say they needed to finish the report.\n\n, who largely opposed the Arizona Senates audit in court until a judge ruled its subpoenas were \"legal and enforceable,\" previously authorized two election machine audits that found no  in the countys 2020 election. There was also a recount of a sample of ballots that did not .\n\nCounty Chairman Jack Sellers released a statement to the Washington Examiner on Thursday after media articles came out over the preliminary audit report, saying that he suspects the Senate will accuse the county on Friday \"of not cooperating, failing to fill holes in the knowledge of the Senates chosen contractor.\"\n\nSellers accused the audit team of having \"no idea how to run any election,\" adding that the county on Friday \"will correct their errors and misrepresentations about the processes they don‚Äôt understand.\"\n\n\"I hope those holding on to their anger for the past 10 months will see the truth and put their energy into supporting the democratic process instead of trying to tear it down,\" Sellers said.\n\nBiden&nbsp;defeated Trump in Arizona by more than 10,000 votes in 2020. Biden edged out Trump by 45,000 votes in Maricopa County, where the former president and other Republicans in the state have alleged fraud despite denials from election officials.\n\nThe Senate is set to debut its complete audit report on Friday at 1 p.m. local time, and it will be  online.\n\nThe Washington Examiner contacted the office of Brnovich but did not immediately receive a response.

Scientists around the world increasingly say that curbing the gas ‚Äî which traps heat 86 times more effectively over 20 years than carbon dioxide ‚Äî is the clearest near-term way to put the planet on a more sustainable temperature trajectory.                    But wrestling methane is presenting a new round of political and practical complications for the Biden administration: Agriculture, including livestock and land-based systems, accounts for 40 percent of global methane emissions ‚Äî spurring concern among Republicans and farm-state Democrats about regulatory efforts to tackle the problem.\n\nSenate Democrats plan to include a so-called ‚Äúmethane polluter fee‚Äù in their $3.5 trillion budget resolution that would hit energy producers that vent or burn off excess methane and compressors used to pressurize and transport natural gas. Several also introduced legislation this month requiring refiners and oil and gas producers operating in the United States to pay into a fund based on a share of their global carbon and methane emissions.\n\n&quot;The methane polluter fee targets industry leakage, which even the fossil fuel industry has a hard time defending,&quot; Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told POLITICO. &quot;I think that the public more and more cares about climate change and people understand that methane is a particularly powerful greenhouse gas ‚Äì indeed more powerful than carbon dioxide. So it seems like addressing it is a good thing.&quot;           \n\n Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Capitol Hill March 2, 2021. | Francis Chung/E&amp;E News\n\nWhitehouse said the Senate Budget Committee informed him that his bill with Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will form the basis of the polluter fee. That legislation calls for a $1,800 per ton fee on oil and gas producers whose emissions rate perform worse than regional averages.\n\nEnvironmental allies who have joined Democrats in challenging the fossil fuel industrys political power, misinformation tactics and for causing climate change also believe addressing methane is a winning political strategy.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs to help the worst performers to clean up their act. It‚Äôs to get them to avoid paying the fee because we‚Äôre basically setting money on fire,&quot; National Wildlife Federation CEO Collin OMara said. &quot;It‚Äôs great policy, but I also think it‚Äôs good politics to be incentivizing companies to reduce their waste, which in the long run is going to end up saving consumers money.‚Äù\n\nMark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, drew connections to ongoing wildfires, droughts and floods in reasoning the public is ready to embrace a fee on methane emissions. He noted that already available technology can reduce oil and gas methane emissions 75 percent from current levels, and that the evolution of remote sensing by drone and aircraft has also reduced costs for curbing methane.\n\n&quot;Over a quarter of the warming we‚Äôre seeing right now is being driven by methane emissions from human activities,&quot; he said. &quot;We know that by controlling methane pollution from the oil and gas industry we can make a major difference in addressing the climate problem that‚Äôs affecting all of us today. That‚Äôs the key issue.‚Äù\n\nBut Republicans are preparing to fight Democrats‚Äô efforts by saying it would increase costs to everyday Americans for things like home heating, electricity and groceries.\n\nA fee on methane emissions would function as an implicit tax hike on Americans with less disposable income, making it &quot;violative&quot; of Bidens pledge to avoid raising taxes on people earning less than $400,000, said Mike McKenna, a Republican lobbyist who works with energy companies.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the Republicans need to do is just remind everybody there has to be cheaper ways to do this,&quot; he said.\n\nSome have taken to calling the proposed methane polluter fee a ‚Äúcow tax‚Äù ‚Äî tied to longstanding GOP efforts to portray Biden and Democrats as going after Americans‚Äô hamburgers.\n\n&quot;Our hard-working livestock producers should not have to worry about being subject to onerous regulations and increased production costs,&quot; Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said this month on the Senate floor about Democrats proposal for a fee on methane emissions. &quot;This cow tax will just result in higher food costs for Americans at the grocery store at a time when inflation already has caused prices to skyrocket.&quot;           \n\n Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) on Capitol Hill Jan. 28, 2021. | Francis Chung/E&amp;E News\n\nThe Biden administration is weighing in on the side of curbing methane emissions, teasing it has big plans it will soon announce, but understanding that it will walk a fine line in doing so as any comprehensive policy to curb methane would have to tackle agriculture. That presents challenges to Democrats wary of alienating rural and centrist voters. So the administration has been careful to avoid talk of new regulations for agriculture, where livestock like cows account for a large share of emissions, instead speaking in terms of carrots such as incentives and voluntary programs for agricultural methane.\n\nOn the energy side, EPA Administrator  after the IPCC report release that ‚Äúwe are developing strong standards to reduce methane ‚Äî a potent greenhouse gas identified by the IPCC for urgent action.‚Äù Those rules would build on Obama-era standards for controlling methane leaks at new and existing oil and gas operations. They are on track for completion in September and would utilize new technology to help locate so-called &quot;super-emitting&quot; methane leaks, according to an EPA spokesperson.\n\n‚ÄúReading the tea leaves, I think this administration is likely to use its whole of government approach and make sure all of its relevant departments ‚Äî including Agriculture and Energy ‚Äî are doing everything possible to reduce this potent climate pollution,‚Äù said Sarah Smith, super pollutants director at environmental group Clean Air Task Force.\n\nThe Biden administration is calculating just how much damage methane causes. White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthys office is working on a social cost of methane, which would assign a monetary value to the benefits of reducing methane that the administration could use to justify regulations.           \n\n White House climate advisor Gina McCarthy and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg during a press conference on President Bidens American Jobs Plan at a newly installed EV charging station at Union Station in Washington, D.C., April 22, 2021. | Francis Chung/E&amp;E News\n\n&quot;We absolutely are looking at climate change and looking to ensure that we consider climate across the administration every action we take. And part of that is revisiting the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane, which is an ongoing reassessment at this point,&quot; McCarthy said in a recent interview.\n\nAnother potential complication lies in the international approach to combating methane emissions. The governments of Japan and other countries and pressure from U.S. oil and gas firms are working to keep options for natural gas open for countries that currently run on coal, such as those in energy-poor Africa, since burning that fuel produces half the carbon dioxide when burned for electricity.\n\nBut greens say an instant switch to zero-emitting energy like wind and solar is all that can save the planet, arguing that methane leaks from producing and transporting natural gas outweigh its supposed climate advantage over coal.\n\nDepartments of Treasury, State and Energy also are putting the final touches on an international climate finance plan, which is expected to include an emissions performance standard that would guide investments in overseas projects, said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director for international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council and Kate DeAngelis, international finance program manager at Friends of the Earth.\n\nThe finance plan will likely include some exemptions that would allow fossil fuel finance ‚Äî particularly oil and natural gas ‚Äî in cases where it promotes development or national security objectives. Between 2008 and 2018, nearly two-thirds of the additional 47 gigawatts of energy capacity supported by bilateral U.S. finance went to fossil fuel projects, particularly natural gas, according to  by researchers at Boston University Global Development Policy Center and Princeton University.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners hope to limit exemptions and are pressing the Biden administration that any investments in natural gas, such as financing facilities in other countries to import liquefied natural gas, are inconsistent with its goals of keeping the planet from heating 1.5 degrees C ‚Äî a case the IPCC report makes all the more clear, Schmidt said.\n\n‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôve been signaling to folks is it‚Äôs going to be an aggressive standard, it‚Äôs going to be a strong signal to the rest of the world,‚Äù Schmidt said. ‚ÄúBut we haven‚Äôt seen the details.‚Äù\n\nThe oil and gas industry contends it is self-motivated to stop methane leaks, given any escaping gas is something they would otherwise sell. But the burdens for detecting and repairing those leaks are less significant for larger producers that have said they are open to methane rules compared with smaller U.S. drillers who find regulations onerous ‚Äî and potentially a death knell. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small drillers,  as a &quot;one-size-fits-all approach&quot; that is &quot;inappropriate and disproportionally impacts conventional operations, low production wells, and small businesses.&quot;\n\nLarger companies are concerned about their social license to operate given ever-restrictive climate rules and growing public angst to address rising emissions, said Kevin OScannlain, vice president of upstream policy with the American Petroleum Institute. API and major oil and gas companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil have thus advocated for methane regulations, though they also are still significant methane emitters.\n\nAPI officials have met with top Biden administration personnel, including Regan and McCarthy, to discuss methane regulations.\n\n&quot;We are actively working with the administration in support of the direct regulation of methane from new and existing sources,&quot; OScannlain said in emailed responses, adding, &quot;[W]e know there is more work to be done and federal policymaking can play a role.&quot;\n\nBut OScannlain said API does not support the Democratic push to impose a methane fee on oil and gas producers, which he said would be duplicative of existing regulations while failing to address emissions from agriculture.\n\nThree sources from the oil and gas sector told POLITICO that they see Democratic proposals to include the fee in a $3.5 trillion Senate budget resolution as an avenue to imposing a price on emissions.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be tough,‚Äù said an oil and gas industry official, who asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations with companies. ‚ÄúThis administration is moving without the wild fluctuations of the previous one on policy, and it seems to be moving directly.‚Äù\n\nBen Lefebvre contributed to this report.                                                                        \n\n &copy; 2021 POLITICO LLC           ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/methane-tax-cattle-pigs/'),

Emerald Robinson, Newsmax‚Äôs White House correspondent, recently re-tweeted a claim that the Moderna ... [+]  Covid-19 vaccine has luciferase.

Similarly, luciferase enzymes have very little to do with Lucifer.\n\nNevertheless, Emerald Robinson, Newsmax‚Äôs White House correspondent, recently tweeted out something that had seemingly little to do with being a White House correspondent. Her tweet claimed that ‚Äúthe vaccines contain a bioluminescent marker called LUCIFERASE so that you can be tracked. Read the last book of the New Testament to see how this ends.‚Äù\n\nSpeaking of tracking, Robinson apparently subsequently deleted her tweet, but not before Justin Baragona, a reporter for The Daily Beast, captured it for posterity:\n\nNow if you are wondering what Newsmax is, it‚Äôs not a brand of sanitary napkin. Instead, Newsmax media includes a website, a print magazine, and a cable news channel. In July,  how a Newsmax anchor suggested that Covid-19 vaccines may be ‚Äúgoing against nature.‚Äù Recently, described Newsmax as a ‚Äúpro-Trump outlet that was sued this year for promoting election fraud conspiracies, questioned mainstream climate science and told readers not to ‚Äúworry too much about CO2 baking the planet.‚Äù                     \n\nEmerald Robinson, while she was a One America News Network White House Correspondent, interviewed ... [+]  Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway (R) on May 1, 2019.

This reaction uses a combination of oxygen, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and compounds called luciferins. This is the basis of bioluminescence, which is when living organisms emit light.   MORE FOR YOU\n\nFor example, in order to do their glowing thing, fireflies use firefly luciferin or (4S)-2-(6-hydroxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylic acid, which looks like a ridiculously strong password.  in greater detail how these reactions occur and why fireflies do their lighting up thing. Firefly larvae can glow to warn predators, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat me. I taste like bleep.‚Äù By contrast, adult fireflies can use glowing or flash patterns for mating. Female fireflies may choose mates based on the flashing patterns of males. Males with higher flashing mates and greater flash intensity may be more attractive to females.                     \n\nLightning bug on a blade of grass with abdomen lit up. (Photo: Getty)        getty\n\nOf course, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for humans. In general, flashing of any type may not make you more attractive to human females. And showing up to a dinner date looking like a gigantic light bulb probably won‚Äôt earn you a second date, unless the restaurant is really dark.\n\nFireflies certainly aren‚Äôt the only organisms to use luciferin reactions to produce light. Certain types of snails, dinoflagellates, bacteria, and fungi have luciferins and luciferase as well.\n\nSo do Covid-19 vaccines have either luciferase or luciferins as Robinson suggested? Well, do you see either of these in ? That would be a hard no. This list has messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), lipids (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000 dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [DSPC]), tromethamine, tromethamine hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, and sucrose but nothing that looks like luciferase or luciferins. The same applies for the Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt‚Äôs not as if humans have been glowing after they got the Covid-19 vaccine. Have you heard anyone say, ‚Äúnow that Susan‚Äôs gotten fully vaccinated, we can see her in the dark and have no more need for a night light?‚Äù So what the heck was Robison talking about when she tweeted ‚Äúso that you can be tracked?‚Äù And how did this whole luciferase in Covid-19 vaccines claim even get started?\n\nWell, take a look at what . She described how scientists at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) have been firefly luciferase to ‚Äúdevelop faster and more accurate diagnostic tests for Covid-19 as well as to analyze potential therapies and gain a clearer understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.‚Äù These scientists have been inserting the luciferase enzyme into the genomes of viruses like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the West Nile virus, and the Zika virus. This then can produce light, which in turn can make it easier to track what‚Äôs happening to the viruses and where they are going in a cell culture, especially when various Covid-19 treatments are tested on them.\n\nSo, if you are a gigantic virus in an even larger laboratory, then yes, scientists may use luciferase track where you are going. However, there‚Äôs no evidence that scientists are using luciferases in Covid-19 vaccines to track where humans are going.\n\nSimilarly, there‚Äôs no evidence that the devil is somehow involved with the Covid-19 vaccines. The luciferase claims on social media may be yet another example of folks twisting out of contact the mention of Covid-19 and something else together. Whenever you hear a claim about vaccines on social media, don‚Äôt draw any conclusions until you dig deeper into the claim. In other words, try to shed more light on the real situation. You know that saying, ‚Äúthe devil is in the details?‚Äù Well, in this case, the details have nothing to do with the devil.\n\nFollow me on&nbsp; &nbsp;or&nbsp;.&nbsp;Check out&nbsp; my&nbsp;.&nbsp;\n\n', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/luciferase-covid-19-vaccines/'),

Ben Carson went on to add \"The brain is like a muscle, you got to work it out and use supplements just like body builders use, but for your brain, and that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been doing to enhance my mental capabilities\".\n\nEveryone that has taken this, from athletes like Tom Brady to actors like Robert De Niro have nothing but praise for the brain booster, which doubles IQ, skyrockets energy levels and connects areas of the brain not previously connected.&nbsp;&nbsp;works so well for these guys, we had to ask... Is it safe?\n\nAfter 7 years Harvard Scientists Finally Break New Ground &amp; Usher In&nbsp;The Future Of Brain Science&nbsp;With Invention Of New Smart Drug That Increases IQ, Memory And Focus Up To %100\n\nOver a decade ago ago Harvard assembled a team of neuroscientists to work on coming up with a natural brain supplement that could&nbsp;effortlessly boost IQ.\n\nToday, those scientists made the breakthrough they were seeking and made the&nbsp;discovery of a lifetime.They came up with a brain boosting smart drug that surpasses all limits of known science.\n\nThe Supplement they created is now THE best treatment available to improve memory, sharpen attention, increase focus and&nbsp;boost overall IQ.\n\nAfter numerous rounds of testing&nbsp;results were astonishing . One test subject was quoted as saying:\n\n\"As soon as I took it started working within minutes of taking it. All of a sudden,&nbsp;it felt like a dark cloud had been lifted up from in front of me.&nbsp;I was more alert, more focused, had long lasting energy, and experienced a mental clarity that I‚Äôd never felt before\" ‚Äì&nbsp;Ben Lishger Harvard Sophomore.\n\nThe Lead Researcher on the team Dr.Rosenhouse gave us an exclusive inside look at the ingredients that make up this revolutionary smart drug:\n\n\"It is engineered with all the ingredients containing vitamins and essentials that your brain needs to ensure improvement in all aspects of cognitive growth, while including short and long term memory, focus, energy, problem solving capabilities and&nbsp;total brain performance.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nWe are all very grateful to have this now, as I believe it can help everyone on the planet and take us to the&nbsp;next stage of evolution.We‚Äôre very proud.\"\n\nHis associate Dr.cortigan went on to say:\n\n\"This revolutionary&nbsp;&nbsp;enables your brain to be the most efficient it can. It energizes the tissue and functions deep at a cellular level. It makes your brain cells perform their task genuinely and&nbsp;keeps away all kinds of mental fatigue or weakness. Its truly a remarkable breakthrough.\" &nbsp;\n\nCould this pill&nbsp;help ordinary people like you and me?\n\nThe only way to find out is to try it an luckily The Harvard team has patented and sold the rights to major manufacturers who currently have a&nbsp;limited 3 month supply.\n\nFor me, my major concern is my work. I feel taking this brain supplement could help improve my work and increase my income.\n\nSometimes, just&nbsp;one simple decision&nbsp;can drastically change the course of your life. Literally, one click could be the difference between living paycheck to paycheck and taking a bus to work to owning mansions, yachts, private jets and&nbsp;never ever having to worry about money ever again.\n\nAs Warren Buffett famously says&nbsp;\"the more you learn, the more you earn\".\n\nAre you ready to take the next step in&nbsp;improving your life, feeling sharper and smarter than ever before and making millions or billions in the process?\n\n\"I wouldn‚Äôt have developed my patent formula if not for this&nbsp;amazingly incredible&nbsp;.\" ‚Äì says Dr. Rosenhouse\n\nAre you ready to find out if this can work for you? We already ordered ours and will be writing a follow up piece on the results, we encourage you to do the same.\n\nThe only thing you have to do is try it and see for yourself.&nbsp;Who knows, maybe this could be the one little decision that changes your life.

However, it&rsquo;s not real.\n\nThe image has been online since at least  and is almost certainly a digital or photo editing effect.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s possible to create aerial art displays using drones (such as those seen at the 2020 ) there appears to be no news coverage or other photos of this display that might confirm whether it happened.&nbsp;\n\nThe background of the display isn&rsquo;t of Mexico City either or anywhere else in the Americas; it was actually taken more than 7,000 miles away at Mount Fuji, Japan. An article by American fact checkers  states the original photo was taken  from the nearby Amariyama mountain range, while  the original picture dates back to at least 2012.

The last tenants abandoned the hovels about three decades ago, and even they would have struggled to imagine a distant daughter of the plantation one day calling the White House home.\r\n \r\n But a historical line can be drawn from these Low Country cabins to Michelle Obama, charting an American familys improbable journey through slavery, segregation, the civil rights movement and a historic presidential election.\r\n \r\n Their documented passage begins with Jim Robinson, Obamas great-great-grandfather, who was born around 1850 and lived as a slave, at least until the Civil War, on the sprawling rice plantation. Records show he remained on the estate after the war, working as a sharecropper and living in the old slave quarters with his wife, Louiser, and their children. He could neither read nor write, according to the 1880 census.\r\n \r\n Robinson would be the last illiterate branch of Michelle Obamas family tree.\r\n \r\n Census records show each generation of Robinsons became more educated than the last, with Michelle Obama eventually earning degrees from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Her older brother, Craig, also received an Ivy League education.\r\n \r\n s campaign hired genealogists to research the familys roots at the onset of his presidential bid, but aides have largely kept the findings secret. Genealogists at Lowcountry Africana, a research center at the University of South Florida in Tampa, scoured documents to put together a 120-page report, according to project director Toni Carrier. She said the center signed a confidentiality agreement and is not allowed to disclose the findings publicly.\r\n \r\n However, in his now-famous speech on race during the primary,  stated he was \"married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners.\"\r\n \r\n Obama aides declined to discuss the report or allow Michelle Obama to be interviewed about her ancestry. She has said she knew little about her family tree before the campaign, but census reports, property records and other historical documents show that her paternal ancestors bore witness to one of the most shameful chapters in American history.\r\n \r\n When Michelle Obama moves into the White House‚Äîa mansion built partially by slaves‚Äîshe will embark upon a life her great-great-grandfather never could have envisioned for her. At antebellum estates such as Friendfield Planation, past sins are being revisited amid the celebration.\r\n \r\n Frances Cheston Train, whose family bought the property in the 1930s and transformed it into a hunting preserve for wealthy Northerners, fights back tears as she reflects on how far the country has come since Robinson labored in the mosquito-infested rice fields along the Sampit River. Though her family never owned slaves, the 82-year-old heiress to the Drexel family banking fortune recalls the segregation laws that divided the Georgetown community.\r\n \r\n \"Its beyond healing,\" Train said of the Obamas success. \"What it has given everyone is a sense of pride that this amazing, intelligent and attractive couple could be connected to Friendfield.\"\r\n \r\n Little is known about Robinsons life at the plantation, beyond that he worked in the riverfront rice fields after the Civil War. Local historians dont know how or when he came to Friendfield, but census records indicate that both his parents were born in South Carolina.\r\n \r\n A map from the early 1870s, when Robinson was living on the plantation, shows three parallel rows of slave cabins, each with 10 to 13 buildings along Slave Street. But by 1911, only 14 were still standing.\r\n \r\n Five single cabins remain today. With their massive fireplaces and wood plank walls, each tells a story about slave life on the plantation.\r\n \r\n The small shacks, only 19 feet deep, housed several families at once, said Ed Carter, who now oversees the property. Large, stone fireplaces were used for cooking and heating. Attic space in the rafters beneath the gable roof offered a place for extra people to sleep.\r\n \r\n The plantations former owner, Francis Withers, built a \"meeting house\" for the slaves on the estate before 1841, and the South Carolina Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church assigned a preacher there. A fire destroyed the church in 1940, but a massive live oak still stands near the old site.\r\n \r\n By the time Withers died in 1847, the family had expanded Friendfield to include six plantations and more than 500 slaves. At the height of the rice trade, Friendfield was one of the most lucrative plantations in the area, producing what was called Carolina Gold on more than 500 acres of rice fields, Carter said.\r\n \r\n In his will, Withers, who was educated at Harvard University, provided for the care of his slaves, including the upkeep of the church and a salary for the preacher. He also requested that his slaves be treated with \"great kindness and be fed and clothed.\" He bequeathed $50 a year to Charlotte Nelson, described as a \"mulatto woman\" who had been freed by his brother, for the rest of her life.\r\n \r\n He left $10,000 to buy more slaves to work the plantation and provided financial incentives for his surviving relatives to retain his \"Friendfield gang of slaves\" as a group and not break up slave families.\r\n \r\n The plantations prosperity faded after the Civil War, and the family began selling off the property in 1879, according to land records. Robinson, like many former slaves, continued to live on the farm.\r\n \r\n Its unclear when Robinson died, but local historians believe he is buried in an unmarked grave in a slave cemetery that overlooks the old rice fields on the edges of Whites Creek.\r\n \r\n Among Robinsons surviving children was Fraser Robinson Sr., Michelle Obamas great-grandfather. Born in 1884, Fraser Sr. went to work as a houseboy for a local family before his 16th birthday. Census records show he was illiterate as a teen but had learned to read and write by the time he had his own children.\r\n \r\n As an adult, Fraser Sr. worked as a lumber mill laborer, shoe repairman and newspaper salesman. He registered for the draft during World War I but was turned down because he had lost his left arm, military records show.\r\n \r\n Fraser Sr. married a local woman named Rose Ella Cohen and had at least six children. Described by a family friend as an intelligent man who wanted his children to be well-read, Fraser Sr. always brought home his extra copies of the Palmetto Leader and Grit, a black newspaper that was popular in rural communities across the country.\r\n \r\n \"He used to make his children read those newspapers,\" said Margretta Dunmore Knox, who still lives in Georgetown and attended the same church as the Robinsons. \"Maybe thats how they became so smart.\"\r\n \r\n His eldest son, Fraser Jr., was born in 1912 and graduated from high school. Census records from 1930 show that 18-year-old Fraser Jr. was living at home and working at a sawmill after earning his degree.\r\n \r\n At the time, Georgetown, a costal town about an hours drive north of Charleston and the states third-oldest city, was split along racial lines. The basic human rights that blacks had known after the Reconstruction era disappeared as the Deep South sank into the Depression and segregationist ways.\r\n \r\n Train recalls playing with black children at Friendfield but not being allowed to go with them to the movies or the beach. She knew her playmates lived in cabins once inhabited by slaves, but no one ever broached the topic.\r\n \r\n \"It was a very painful memory,\" said Train, who still winters at the hunting preserve and has written a memoir about the estate titled \"A Carolina Plantation Remembered: In Those Days.\" \"It was not something we ever talked about.\"\r\n \r\n As Georgetowns economy crumbled, Fraser Jr. headed north to Chicago in search of employment. Once there, he met and married LaVaughn Johnson.\r\n \r\n Their son Fraser Robinson III‚ÄîMichelle Obamas father‚Äîwas born in 1935.\r\n \r\n Though they never attended college, Fraser III and his wife, Marian, made education a top priority for their two children. Both would later attend Princeton and earn postgraduate degrees from prestigious universities.\r\n \r\n Fraser Jr. and LaVaughn Robinson lived on the South Side for part of Michelles childhood, before retiring and moving down South. After returning to Georgetown, the couple joined the Bethel AME Church, which was founded by freed slaves in 1865 and is the oldest black church in the city. The couple sang in the choir and built a large circle of friends, Knox said.\r\n \r\n Michelle Obama returned to the same church in January while campaigning for her husband in the South Carolina primary.\r\n \r\n Addressing a packed audience that included at least 30 descendants of Jim Robinson, Obama talked about the need for change in the confident voice of a distant daughter of slavery.\r\n \r\n \"Things get better when regular folks take action to make change happen from the bottom up,\" she said. \"Every major historical moment in our time, it has been made by folks who said, Enough, and they banded together to move this country forward‚Äîand now is one of those times.\"\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n                      Advertisement                    Advertisement             Advertisement             Advertisement                   Advertisement                                   Advertisement                                      CONNECT    \n\nTRIBUNE PUBLISHING      \n\nCOMPANY INFO\n\n Copyright &copy; 2021, Chicago Tribune                  ', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/michelle-obama-slave-ancestor/');

They had strict and careful rules about sentencing a punishment for a crime. No one, they believed, should be executed for a first offense, and every criminal&rsquo;s good deeds should be considered before handing down judgement. If someone was going to suffer, he should deserve it.\n\nBut if you did deserve it, the Persians made sure you paid for it. They came up with some of the most imaginative and brutal punishments in history. Justice in ancient Persia wasn&rsquo;t always swift&mdash;it was a slow, prolonged, and painful torture torn from your worst nightmares.\n\n Photo credit:\n\nWhen a Persian judge named Sisamnes was caught accepting a bribe, King Darius was determined to make an example out of him. The courts of Persia, Darius believed, should be impartial and fair. He was going to be sure that Sisamnes&rsquo;s replacement didn&rsquo;t make the same mistake.\n\nSisamnes was , but that was just the start. After his throat had been slit, Darius had the executioners flay off every inch of his skin and make them into strips of human leather. Then he had them sew together a chair made of Sisamnes&rsquo;s skin. From then on, the new judge would have to sit on a .\n\nIt gets worse: Sisamnes&rsquo;s replacement was his own son. As he presided over Persia&rsquo;s trials, he would have to spend every day sitting on a chair made of his father&rsquo;s flesh. Now, King Darius believed, they would have a judge who would never forget what happened if he accepted a bribe.\n\n\r\n One of the worst deaths you could suffer in ancient Persia was suffocation by ashes. It was a punishment reserved for the worst criminals: those guilty of high treason or offenses against the gods. And it was horrifying.\n\nThe Persians kept a 23-meter-tall (75 ft) hollow tower that was filled with nothing but ashes and wheels. At the top was a sliding platform, and the  would be taken to it and thrown in. He would plummet down into the center of the tower. The fall would likely break a few bones, but the ashes would keep him alive long enough to suffer the slower, more brutal death they had planned.\n\nThe executioners would turn the wheels. Men outside would put them into motion, swirling the ashes around to force them into the convict&rsquo;s nose and mouth. He would inhale them, suffocating on burned ashes until he died.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a sentence more than a few people faced, and it even shows up in . In it, a corrupt Jewish priest is killed by the Persians in the tower of ashes. When he dies, his family isn&rsquo;t allowed to bury his remains. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; the Bible says to conclude the story, &ldquo;was just what he deserved.&rdquo;\n\n\r\n When the Roman emperor Valerian was captured by Persian soldiers, he met a horrible end. He died a death that might sound like something pulled out of . The real story, though, is much, much worse.\n\nPersian emperor Shapur I kept Valerian as his personal slave. He would parade him in front of his army, his hands and legs shackled, treating him like a dog. He humiliated him every way he could. Before mounting his horse, Shapur would make Valerian get down on his hands and knees so that he could use him as a human stool.\n\nWhen Shapur got bored of his toy, he killed him. He poured molten gold down Valerian&rsquo;s throat. Then he had the emperor of Rome taxidermied. Valerian was skinned and stuffed with straw, and his  was put on display in a Persian temple&mdash;a trophy of gold and human remains.\n\n\r\n In the later years of Persia,  had to deal with horrifying punishments. Anyone caught stealing or harassing a rider on the roads of the empire was sentenced to death&mdash;by being torn in half.\n\nThe  would pull the tops of two trees as close to one another as they could and tie them together. They would drag the convict over and tie one leg to the top of each tree. Then they would cut the cord holding the trees together.\n\nThe two trees would spring free, pulling apart at incredible speeds and shooting back upright with the criminal still tied to them. His body would tear in half from the force. Within a second, two halves of what was once one man would hang from the trees.\n\nHis body would be left there, hanging over the road where he&rsquo;d robbed an innocent person. Anyone who passed through these parts, the Persians believed, would get a harsh reminder of just what would happen if they followed the lives of thieves.\n\n\r\n As much as Persia tried to be fair about its crimes, they didn&rsquo;t exactly ignore class status. The king could get away with anything, and as long as they were in his good books, his family could, too. When King Artaxerxes II&rsquo;s own mother murdered his wife, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to execute her&mdash;so he killed her servants, instead.\n\nParysatis, Artaxerxes&rsquo;s mother, hated her daughter-in-law Stateira, and Stateira hated her right back. They had to pretend to be civil in public, but they tried to kill each other so often that Artaxerxes had to set up rules to keep them from pulling it off. When they dined together, he ordered that everything they ate had to be cut in two and shared so that they couldn&rsquo;t poison each other.\n\nIt didn&rsquo;t work. Parysatis had  put on one side of a knife and had her servant use it to cut the meat, poisoning the half that went to Stateira and keeping her half untainted. It worked, and the king&rsquo;s mother  the queen.\n\nIt was obvious, of course, who was responsible, but Artaxerxes couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to kill his mother. He had all her servants tortured until they confessed. Then he had the meat cutter&rsquo;s head smashed in with a rock. Parysatis, though, was just sent into exile.\n\nIt didn&rsquo;t take long before Artaxerxes invited her right back. And she helped him pick a new wife: Parysatis convinced Artaxerxes to marry his own daughter.\n\n Photo credit:\n\nIt was fairly common in Persia and the nations around it to  rebels by cutting off their noses and ears. That kind of brutal torture, though, wasn&rsquo;t always a death sentence. Sometimes, they kept you alive. And sometimes, that was worse than death.\n\nWhen the people revolted against King Darius, he made sure everyone knew what would happen if they turned against him again. He rounded up the rebel leaders and cut off their noses, ears, and tongues and plucked out one of each of their eyes&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t kill them. Not yet.\n\nThe rebel leaders were chained up and bound to the front gate of his castle so that everyone who walked by it would see their mutilated bodies. Their lieutenants, meanwhile, were , and their heads were hung from the top of the city citadel.\n\nThey were left there for weeks, being jeered and beaten by everyone who walked by, staring at the remains of their friends and suffering in excruciating pain. Then, when they couldn&rsquo;t take anymore, they were allowed to die.\n\n\r\n In Persia,  were called the Magi. This didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they had magical powers; they were religious leaders. And after one of them got a little overambitious, their jobs became hell.\n\nA Magi named Smerdis tricked the people into believing he was the son of Cyrus the Great and got himself crowned as king of Persia. He was actually a great king, loved by his people. He introduced tax reforms that made life easier and relaxed the laws on military conscription&mdash;but he stole the throne, so naturally, he had to die.\n\nWhen the people found out, they didn&rsquo;t stop at murdering Smerdis. They ran through the streets of the kingdom, spreading the word and  of the Magi they could find.\n\nWhen the massacre was over, the people decided to make it an annual event. Once every year, the Persians celebrated a holiday called &ldquo;the Slaughter of the Magi.&rdquo; On the anniversary of Smerdis&rsquo;s death, they would run through the streets, and if they caught any Magi outside, they would brutally murder them.\n\n might already be the best-known of the Persian punishments, but the list would be incomplete without it. Few tortures compare.\n\nThis torture was reserved for people the king really hated. The victim would be stripped naked and put inside of a hollowed-out tree trunk or two boats, with his heads, hands, and feet sticking out and exposed to the Sun. Then he would be force-fed milk and honey until he had  and became literally buried in his own filth.\n\nThe torturers would rub honey over the exposed parts of his body to lure over insects. Bugs would crawl over the convict and slowly eat away at his flesh, while wasps would agonize with their stingers until he prayed for death.\n\nThe torturers, though, would continue to force-feed him to keep him alive for as long as possible. After a few days, the victim&rsquo;s mind would start to deteriorate, but he would still be alive. It could take weeks before his body finally gave out and died. The first time they tried it, it took 17 days of agony and praying for death before the victim&rsquo;s prayers were finally answered.\n\n\r\n Some people, the Persians believed, deserved more than one death. If their crime was  enough, they wouldn&rsquo;t settle to kill them once. They&rsquo;d make them die three deaths before they were allowed to stop breathing.\n\nThe victims wouldn&rsquo;t actually die, but they would go through the  three times. When a eunuch angered the wife of Cyrus the Great, for example, she first had his eyes pulled out of his head. Then, once he&rsquo;d recovered, she had him flayed alive. Then they nursed him back to health again before finally crucifying him.\n\nIt wasn&rsquo;t the only time it happened. After a soldier tried to take credit for killing Cyrus the Younger in battle when he&rsquo;d really only wounded him, the king ordered his execution. The king&rsquo;s mother, though, intervened, saying, &ldquo;Leave him to me, and he shall receive the fitting reward for his daring words.&rdquo;\n\nFirst, she had him stretched out on the wheel for ten days. Then she gouged out his eyes. And then, finally, she finished him off&mdash;by pouring molten brass into his ears until he died.\n\n Photo credit:\n\nA Median general named Harpagus went through the worst  possible for the lightest offense. King Astyages had a dream that his grandson would overthrow him, so he ordered Harpagus to take the infant out into the wilderness and leave him to die. Harpagus, instead, gave the baby to a shepherd, who raised the child as his own.\n\nIt took ten years for Astyages to find out he&rsquo;d been disobeyed, but when he did, he was vicious. He cut Harpagus&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s throat, chopped him from limb to limb, roasted his flesh, and served him to Harpagus at a banquet.\n\nAt first, Harpagus didn&rsquo;t know what he was eating or even that his son was dead. Astyages, however, made his servants put the dead boy&rsquo;s head on the table in front of him and taunted him, saying, &ldquo;Do you know what beast&rsquo;s meat you have eaten?&rdquo;\n\nHarpagus knew what would happen to him if he tried to take . He couldn&rsquo;t even dare to cry in front of the king who had murdered and fed him his own son. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Harpagus was forced to say, &ldquo;and all that the king does is pleasing.&rdquo;\n\nHe complimented Astyages on the dish and asked to take the rest with him. Then he carried what they&rsquo;d let him take back to his home and buried the last remains of his son.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nRead more horrific punishments from the past on  and .

Images of suffering children in world politics are often used as a synecdoche for a broader conflict or disaster. Injured, suffering, or dead; the ways in which images of children circulate in global public discourse must be critically examined to uncover the assumptions that operate in these environments. This article explores reactions to images of children by representatives and leaders of states to trace the interconnected affective and political dimensions of these images. In contrast to attending to the expected empathetic responses prompted by images of children, this article particularly focuses on when such images prompt bellicose foreign policy decision-making. In doing this, the article forwards a way of thinking about images as contentious affective objects in international relations. The ways in which images of childrens bodies and suffering are strategically deployed by politicians deserves closer scrutiny to uncover the visual politics of childhood inherent in these moments of international politics and policy-making.', '2020', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=mdash+politics+political+trump+jr+killed+kills&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 1),

Warshaw, Lynn Vavreck, Ryan Baxter-King', 'Between early March and July 1, COVID-19 took the lives of over 130,000 Americans. Here, we examine the political consequences of these fatalities for President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates for federal offices. We leverage granular data on COVID-19 fatalities and the attitudes of the American public. We find that COVID-19 has led to significant political damage for President Trump and other Republican candidates. States and local areas with higher levels of COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support President Trump and Republican candidates for House and Senate. Our results show that President Trump and other Republican candidates would benefit electorally from a reduction in COVID-19 fatalities. This implies that a greater emphasis on social distancing, masks, and other mitigation strategies would benefit the president and his allies. ‚àóAssociate Professor, Department of Political Science, George Washington University, warshaw@gwu.edu ‚Ä†Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics, Department of Political Science, UCLA lvavreck@ucla.edu ‚Ä°PhD Student, Department of Political Science, UCLA, ryanbaxterking@g.ucla.edu 1 Between early March and July 1, COVID-19 took the lives of over 130,000 Americans. COVID-19 has killed nearly four times as many Americans as were killed in the Korean War, over twice as many as in Vietnam, and thirty times as many Americans as were killed in the entire Iraq War. Americans broadly disapprove of the President‚Äôs handling of the pandemic. But, as of yet, there has been no clear causal evidence about whether the rise in COVID-19 fatalities has led Americans to turn away from President Trump. A large academic literature has shown that the American public holds presidents accountable for their performance in office (Ashworth 2012; Healy and Malhotra 2013). Among other things, the public penalizes a president and others in their party for casualties in war. Areas with more local casualties, for example, were among the first to turn against the Vietnam War between 1965-1972 (Gartner, Segura, and Wilkening 1997); and during the Iraq War, people who knew someone who died on 9/11 or in the Iraq War were consistently more likely to disapprove of George W. Bush (Gartner 2008). As a result, states with greater losses were more likely to vote against President Bush in the 2004 presidential election (Karol and Miguel 2007). Voters also punished Republican candidates at other levels of office: areas with higher casualties from the War in Iraq were more likely to support Democratic House and Senate candidates in the 2006 midterm elections (Grose and Oppenheimer 2007; Kriner and Shen 2007). Finally, areas with higher casualties in the War in Afghanistan penalized Barack Obama‚Äôs Democratic successor in 2016, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, by supporting Donald Trump in greater numbers (Kriner and Shen 2020). The U.S. President has likened his battle against COVID-19 to that of a ‚Äúwar-time president.‚Äù Voters may also see him that way. Based on previous studies of the political costs of war-time casualties, we hypothesize that the American public will be less likely to support President Trump and other Republican candidates for federal offices in areas with higher levels of COVID-19 fatalities. 1. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/approval-trumps-coronavirus-response-underwater-returnscampaign-trail/story?id=71351241 2.

Black humor is political commentary that resonates with the Black community because the tweets address or refer to Black trauma during the pandemic: dealing with continued racial violence, white supremacist ideology, and medical disparities based on race. The tweets are also expressions of Black Twitter catharsis (joy despite pain) through witty one-sided Twitter banters that skillfully and playfully engage with several facets of the social and political climate.

In a marketplace platform, these operational challenges are even harder to solve, due to the lack of control that exists in the order processing process of each one of the partners that sell through the website. With new players entering the market every year and with the increasing complexity of more partners joining, it is fundamental to have a flawless, competitive and uniform shopping experience. This dissertation will focus on one of the steps that occur in every order: the selection of the adequate packaging for each specific parcel. The amount of air shipped every year in empty box space is just a waste of money and resources that is negatively perceived by many customers. This effect is particularly notorious during peak season, partners neglect the packaging choice even more, due the lack of awareness of the negative impact that sending a bigger box has. During 2018, Farfetch discovered an opportunity to reduce shipping costs, while increasing customer experience and reducing the ecological footprint, by giving a recommendation of which box is more adequate for each order. A new process to keep track of the boxes that are actually sent was put in place and an incentive was launched to encourage partners to start using the smallest box possible. To monitor the progress a new metric was established -Packaging Accuracywhich reflects the percentage of boxes sent correctly. However, results were not as positive as expected, after an initial lift of over 4% in Packaging Accuracy it returned quickly to beginning values. This project was created with the objective to understand what are the main reasons for the partners not to follow the recommendation provided. The goals are to describe the actual problem that is being faced, to detect main causes of error and to delineate lines of action to solve them, going beyond the monetary incentive, which does not commit partners in the long term. During this work two main methodologies were used: Design Thinking Double Diamond and Continuous Improvement tools. With the combination of both frameworks, it was possible to create a more open and disruptive environment, to draw solutions and make suggestions while still grounding the initiatives with savings and prioritizing them rationally. For all the different opportunities that were identified, they can be clustered in two main consequences: 1) Farfetch packaging recommendations given are wrong, which resulted in a loss of credibility in the suggestion; 2) Partners are not engaged with the cause; either the partners‚Äô employees do not see the recommendations or they are not provided with any guidelines for how to select the most adequate package. After an in-depth analysis, an action plan was created that would enable Farfetch to reach the target of 85% of the orders being sent in the correct box, starting from a baseline of 74%. The framework used allowed to understand the main weaknesses of the process, the reasons why previous initiatives were not successful, provide guidelines to correct them and design an implementation plan that will Farfetch to unfold this huge improvement potential. Even though, the implementation is still ongoing, some savings could already be measured.', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=amazon+boxes+package+packages+packaging+shipping+shipped+snopes&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 2),

This report describes stability and performance testing of three classes of assays (TaqMan¬Æ Gene Expression Assays, TaqMan¬Æ MicroRNA Assays, and TaqMan¬Æ SNP Genotyping Assays) after subjecting them to simulated summer ambient shipping conditions. Functional and stability testing demonstrated that TaqMan¬Æ Assay products that underwent simulated summer ambient shipping conditions performed as well as assays shipped on dry ice. By shipping at ambient conditions, the need for expanded polystyrene (EPS) coolers and dry ice is eliminated and the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from transporting the product are significantly reduced. INTRODUCTION The adverse environmental impact of shipping refrigerated or frozen products is tremendous. The annual carbon footprint to manufacture the EPS and convert it into coolers for our TaqMan¬Æ Assay products is approximately 100 tons (CO2-equivalents). It takes nearly 300 barrels of crude oil equivalents and 400 MWhr of power annually to make the EPS coolers that are used to ship Life Technologies genomic assay products [1]. Additionally, 75,000 liters of water are consumed in the manufacture of the EPS coolers [1]. An average of 7 pounds of dry ice is added to each cooler to ensure the product is delivered frozen to our customers, further increasing the mass and dimensions of each package. Factoring in the number of shipments and average distance traveled per package and the fact that most packages are shipped via air, the annual total carbon footprint for transporting frozen oligonucleotides is in excess of 100 tons (CO2-equivalents) [2]. Life Technologies has been systematically evaluating novel ways to minimize the impact of shipping products on dry ice, and the CO2 footprint left by these products during distribution. One way to achieve this is to ship products at a temperature consistent with its demonstrated stability. By avoiding the cooler and refrigerant, products could be shipped in smaller boxes, which improves the carrier‚Äôs freight density (less fuel and emissions per box) and reduces the amount of packaging materials requiring disposal or recycling. This enables Life Technologies to eliminate an annual total of nearly 26,000 kg (70,000 ft3) of EPS from landfills and incinerators and replace it with recyclable corrugated paper packaging. By combining the elimination of EPS and reduction in impact attributed to transporting the added weight of the dry ice, we reduce the annual total carbon footprint from product delivery by over 200 tons (CO2-equivalents) [1,2]. For many years, TaqMan¬Æ Assays have been shipped as preformulated liquid products on dry ice [3]. Extensive accelerated stability studies (4 weeks at 37¬∞C) followed by real-time functional testing showed that TaqMan¬Æ Assay products are stable for at least 5 years when stored at ‚Äì20¬∞C. For this reason, the products were shipped under conditions aligned with their long-term stability temperature. Additional freeze/thaw stability data have shown that TaqMan¬Æ Assay products remain stable for multiple freeze/thaw cycles without compromising their functional performance. This paper describes the results from functional and stability studies carried out after TaqMan¬Æ Assay products were exposed to established summer shipment profiles. These experiments demonstrate that by shipping our TaqMan¬Æ Assay products under ambient conditions, not only can we supply researchers with the same superior quality product they are used to receiving, but we can reduce our environmental footprint in the process. This is a win for our company (eliminating the need for managing cold chain transport), a win for our customers (minimizing packaging waste), and a win for our planet (reducing resource consumption and total carbon footprint). MATERIALS AND METHODS Products Tested. TaqMan¬Æ Assays comprise a preformulated set of unlabeled gene-specific oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent dye‚Äì labeled minor groove binding (MGB) probe(s) provided in liquid form in approved Matrix storage tubes. Assays were selected to represent the widest range of performance as well as chemical, sequence, and structural motifs. In this paper a total of 42 different TaqMan¬Æ Assays were subjected to simulated summer ambient shipping conditions and subsequently measured for physical integrity and functional performance. These assays were selected from five product lines that fell into three representative TaqMan¬Æ Assay products, based on their formulations (Table 1). Note: TaqMan Copy Number Assays, Custom TaqMan Copy Number Assays, ncRNA Assays, and pri-miRNA assays were not included in this testing as the tested assay products were considered to be similar enough to be representative of all product lines. TaqMan CNV Reference Gene and Endogenous Control kits were not included in this study, but are being investigated to ‚Äúgo ambient‚Äù in the near future. Creating Replicates. To help eliminate manufacturing lot variability when creating the replicates, individual tubes representing the various assays were taken from inventory stock, pooled, and aliquoted into Matrix tubes at the same fill volume as specified for the manufactured product. Six replicate tubes and six replicate control tubes were prepared for each assay, for a total of 252 test sample tubes and 252 control sample tubes (matched replicate sets). The control tubes were kept at ‚Äì20¬∞C for the duration of the testing. Simulated Shipping Temperature Exposure. To simulate temperatures incurred during shipping, samples were placed in a cycling environmental chamber (temperature and humidity controlled) programmed to reproduce a ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù 144 hr (6 day) summer temperature profile (sequentially ran two times for a total of 288 hr) (Figure 1), previously established from testing profiles established at Amgen [4]. This profile mimics temperature extremes encountered from over 2,500 shipments during summer months between the latitudes of 59.9¬∞ north and 37.8¬∞ south. Due to a failure in the chamber control system, an additional 3-day room temperature (~25¬∞C) incubation was added to the cycle as indicated in the graph (Figure 1) [4]. Samples were exposed to the 144 hr temperature cycle twice to account for inter-company shipments before being delivered to our customers. Testing of winter ambient conditions was not considered due to the extensive, positive historical data on freeze/thaw and low-temperature stability of TaqMan¬Æ Gene Expression and SNP Assays (data not shown). Handling. In addition to the summer ambient temperature cycle, the products and packaging were subjected to reduced pressures and drop and vibrational tests as detailed under International Safe Transit Association (ISTA 3A) simulated performance protocols Figure 1. 144-Hr Summer Temperature Profile Used to Simulate Shipping Temperatures. The summer temperature profile was used to mimic average high temperature extremes between the latitudes of 59.9¬∞ north and 37.8¬∞ south (profile derived from the Amgen protocol as described). A controller failure induced a 3-day increase in exposure to normal room temperatures, further increasing the stringency of the challenge. [5]. To ensure ambient/liquid product will arrive intact, we redesigned the packaging for orders of 16 tubes or less. To simulate the damage-producing pressure, motions, and forces typically encountered in the shipping and distribution environment, the package was tested according to the ISTA 3A Test Protocol [5]. Analytical Testing Volume and Concentration. Volume and concentration for all test sample tubes were measured before and after the ambient shipping simulation. Volume was measured by gravimetric analysis and concentration was measured spectroscopically at OD260. Stability/Integrity.

The objectives of this research were to study the effects of sweet cherry storage O 2 and CO 2 concentrations on the respiratory physiology and the efficacy of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on extending shelf life. Oxygen depletion and CO 2 formation by ‚ÄòBing‚Äô and ‚ÄòSweetheart‚Äô cherry fruit were measured. While respiration rate was inhibited linearly by reduced O 2 concentration from 21% to 3‚Äì4% at 20¬†¬∞C, it was affected very little from 21% to ‚àº10% but declined logarithmically from ‚àº10% to ‚àº1% at 0¬†¬∞C. Estimated fermentation induction points determined by a specific increased respiratory quotient were less than 1% and 3‚Äì4% O 2 for both cultivars at 0 and 20¬†¬∞C, respectively. ‚ÄòBing‚Äô and ‚ÄòSweetheart‚Äô cherry fruits were packaged (‚àº8¬†kg/box) in 5 different commercial MAP box liners and a standard macro-perforated polyethylene box liner (as control) and stored at 0¬†¬∞C for 6 weeks.

Frame, Gilles Brachotte', 'The electoral campaigns of both Trump and Macron took place in a climate marked by accusations of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, manipulation of social media and personal attacks. Previous research has even shown that the same automated Twitter accounts were used to spread rumours to discredit both Hillary Clinton and later Emmanuel Macron, notably during the ‚ÄúMacron Leaks‚Äù scandal (Ferrara, 2017), which has led to accusations of orchestrated foreign infiltration in at least the French presidential campaign. Although it is difficult to distinguish (legitimate) foreign discussions of (rumours related to) French presidential candidates on Twitter on the one hand and intentional meddling in national politics on the other, it has been suggested that such foreign interference is becoming common practice worldwide (Woolley & Howard, 2017). Discussions on social networking sites (SNS) have become an important focus of political debate and are sometimes taken as a preliminary indicator of public opinion by mainstream media. Their manipulation involves the use of ‚Äúsocial robots‚Äù (bots). ‚ÄúA social bot is a defined as ‚Äúcomputer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior.‚Äù (Ferrara, Varol, Davis, Menczer, & Flammini, 2016, p. 96).Research in computer science has proposed various methods to detect social bots on Twitter (Clark et al., 2016; Danisch, Dugue, & Perez, 2014; Davis, Varol, Ferrara, Flammini, & Menczer, 2016; Dickerson, Kagan, & Subrahmanian, 2014; Edwards, Edwards, Spence, & Shelton, 2014). Although studies suggest that bots are in many cases still detectable in the field of political propaganda (Grimme, Preuss, Adam, & Trautmann, 2017), other research warns that these algorithms are becoming increasingly complex and able to replicate human behaviour through machine learning (Ferrara et al., 2016, p. 99). Social bots are now widely used in various contexts, including political communication, and notably during election campaigns (Woolley & Howard, 2016), especially on Twitter. Research has shown that social bots were used on Twitter during the 2016 US presidential election, for example to spread links to fake news websites (P. N. Howard, Bolsover, Kollanyi, Bradshaw, & Neudert, 2017), and have been estimated responsible for up to one fifth of campaign-related content produced in the lead-up to Trump‚Äôs victory (Bessi & Ferrara, 2016). They were also used in the 2017 French presidential elections (Ferrara, 2017; P. N. Howard, Bradshaw, Kollanyi, & Bolsolver, 2017a, 2017b), in the Brexit referendum campaign (P. Howard & Kollanyi, 2016), and in recent elections in Venezuela (Forelle, Howard, Monroy-Hernandez, & Savage, 2015) and Russia (Stukal, Sanovich, Bonneau, & Tucker, 2017), among many others. Bots can be used to diffuse or relay large quantities of positive or negative content pertaining to a candidate or political movement, spread rumours or links to ‚Äújunk news‚Äù or ‚Äúfake news‚Äù websites, though some research suggests that their impact on human interactions may remain limited (Murthy et al., 2016). Bots are also used to create automated followers or politicians‚Äô or parties‚Äô accounts, another common practice in US , French (Boyadjian, 2015) and other elections. Finally, discussions on SNS during election campaigns include messages generated by news bots, which may affect the information being spread, even when not having been intentionally programmed to favour one candidate or another (Lokot & Diakopoulos, 2016). This contribution aims to further research into this new dimension of electronic electioneering, which requires interdisciplinary approaches. Based on a study involving research teams in both communication science and computer science, working from a corpus of approximately 50M election-related tweets collected over five weeks in April and May 2017, and in the light of previous research into the ‚ÄúMacron Leaks‚Äù scandal (Ferrara, 2017) and use of campaign-bots in the US presidential elections (Bessi & Ferrara, 2016), it will (i) identify the presence of likely social bots on Twitter during the French presidential elections, and (ii) measure and analyse their activity pertaining to the two candidates between the first and second rounds of the election.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015. 352p. $93.00 cloth, $33.99 paper.', 'E. Ritter', 'laid in large part at the feet of the news media. Allen and Birch sketch out a new dynamic that has media companies covering and promoting stories about government scandals with the sole purpose of attracting consumers. In the steady rain of scandal-related stories amplified by coverage and drama, the public fails to recognize that the misconduct is being undertaken by a small minority of elected representatives. The news media do not so much undermine trust in elected representatives as create an aura of suspicion about the behaviors and motivations of all elected representatives. Politicians find it difficult to respond to this mistrust, in part because of partisanship. As the authors wryly note, in the tribal setting of politics there is little thought among political opponents to collectively guard their honor (p. 189). To a certain extent, Allen and Birch are correct about the news media. Certainly, news organizations are struggling for readers, listeners, and viewers, and they are willing to highlight dramatic and controversial stories in order to attract consumers of their news. But while it is easy to focus on the messenger, the message sender figures in the equation as well. In many cases, the story of ethical breaches originates with the partisan opposition. The rise of media politics in campaigns is another factor that Allen and Birch recognize but do not fully develop. Parties are still the effective force in organizing legislatures, but in the electoral arena, media politics, with its long-standing emphasis on image, has become more important. Media politics is image politics, which is popular among candidates because it is hard to argue with an image, minimizing the need to be conversant on policy. But images can be attacked, and that means that parties and candidates in Great Britain and elsewhere frequently use questions about their opponents‚Äô ethics to undermine their opponents‚Äô images. The use of ethical allegations and suggestions in negative advertising grows in modern campaigns because it works, but it also denigrates the public‚Äôs sense of integrity among politicians. One of the tactics employed by the populist parties to undermine the dominance of the leading parties was to play on the discontent and dissatisfaction of the electorate with the status quo. Allen and Birch are no strangers to this idea. Their study supports a suggestion that probity is more important to voters than candidate or party performance (p. 75). While it may be easy to dismiss a study of British attitudes towards ethics and integrity based on 2009‚Äì10 data as dated, this is certainly not the case with Allen and Birch‚Äôs study. It stands as a model for how to study public attitudes toward elected politicians, and the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election suggests the need for similar analysis in the American setting. Trump‚Äôs dismissal of conflict-of-interest concerns and his family‚Äôs tone-deaf response to profiting from the presidency suggests a coming debate over American perceptions of ethics, integrity, and misconduct that is likely to exceed the existing legal framework governing the ethics of elected officials. Even as this review was being written in early 2017, the Republican House caucus secretly voted to amend its rules to abolish independent investigations of ethics breaches, a move that was rolled back by a substantial public outcry and a tweet from President-Elect Trump. That would speak to the very gap between public and elite perceptions of acceptable ethical behavior that Allen and Birch have so aptly identified.', '2017', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+media+sketch+created+powell&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 3),

LeCrom', 'IntroductionFrom a media perspective, the contemporary sport fan has never had it better. On any given Sunday in the fall, one has the ability to watch eight live National Football League (NFL) games at once on a 70\" High Definition television while streaming four others to a tablet via DirecTVs NFL Sunday Ticket To-Go. At the same time, one could listen to the in- car audio of the NASCAR race, digitally record a National Hockey League (NHL) game while following and being part of the World Series conversation on Twitter. Meanwhile, there is still the ability to stream live coverage of the one-hole Ryder Cup playoff directly to a laptop while also texting vigorously back and forth with a fantasy football opponent about a controversial touchdown celebration.With all these options, mediated sport fans have several choices to ensure they make the most of their limited amount of disposable time and money. What to watch? What to listen to? What platform to use? What to subscribe to? What package to pay for? Who to communicate with? What to say and with what medium to say it? The list could go on and on. Given the growing importance of multimedia rights and broadcast ratings, the results of these choices create time-sensitive and money-dependent patterns of behavior that ultimately fuel or destroy sport products. Thus, from a marketing and management perspective, understanding the mediated consumer decision making process within todays highly- cluttered sport marketplace is at a premium (Pritchard & Funk, 2006).One means for examining consumer decision-making is through the application and analysis of Fazio, Powell, and Herrs (1983) attitude-behavior relationship framework. As a theoretical model, this relationship has been examined extensively in the areas of psychology, social psychology, marketing, and advertising for decades (e.g., Cleveland, Kalamas, & Laroche, 2005; Fazio, Powell, & Williams, 1989; Kokkinaki, 1999; LeBel, 2010). In addition, according to Foxall (1990), this extension of cognitive psychology is widely-accepted as the dominant paradigm for understanding contemporary consumer behavior.One growing form of professional sport consumption is fantasy sports participation, and within the last decade, the activity has emerged as a captivating context for sport consumer inquiry due to the populations avid, yet atypical consumption behavior (Lomax, 2006). Through the application of Fazio et al.s (1983) attitude-behavior relationship framework, Drayer, Shapiro, Dwyer, Morse, and White (2010) created a conceptual model for explaining the relationship between fantasy football participation and the consumption of NFL products and services.The model suggested that fantasy football participation led to an altered perception of the NFL and enhanced consumption of related media products and services (see Figure 1). Grounded in the same framework, the purpose of the current chapter was to extend Drayer et al.s conceptual framework by uniquely exploring the relationship between novice fantasy football participants attitudes and behaviors with respect to televised NFL games.Novice participants were defined as individuals with less than three years of fantasy football experience. This population was explicitly targeted so the participants could more clearly remember attitudes and behaviors associated with participating and not participating in the activity. Television viewership was chosen as the behavioral outcome due to its importance in explaining sport consumer attitudes (Mahony & Moorman, 1999), its prevalence in our society, and its significance as an output of fantasy sports participation (Drayer et ah, 2010; Dwyer, 2011b; Nesbit & King, 2010).Review of LiteratureFantasy SportsIn recent years, fantasy sports participants, in particular fantasy football, have begun to receive more and more attention from marketers, media providers, broadcasters, and academics as the industry has blossomed into an $800 million a year business (Fantasy Sports Trade Association [FSTA], 2008). ‚Ä¶', '2013', 6, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+media+sketch+created+powell&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 3),

Fargo', 'Part I: Introduction For close to forty years, the fate of journalists wishing to conceal the identities of confidential sources from government bodies with subpoena power has depended upon how one heavily divided United States Supreme Court opinion is interpreted. The Courts 5-4 decision in Branzburg v. Hayes1 in 1972 represents its last word - so far2 - on whether journalists have a constitutional right under the First Amendment press clause3 to refuse to identify sources of information to grand juries, prosecutors, criminal defendants, civil litigants, legislators, and others. With prospects for a federal journalists shield law still uncertain at this writing,4 journalists may continue to rely on interpretations of Branzburg for protection for some time. Because the Branzburg decision was closely divided, lower court interpretations have focused on a brief concurring opinion by Justice Lewis Powell.5 The Powell concurrence is not necessarily a ringing endorsement of the majority opinion, but it also stops short of endorsing either dissent. Lower federal courts and some state courts have resolved the resulting confusion through ad hoc decision-making, while other states have created shield statutes that protect journalists to varying degrees. But recently in the federal courts, journalists protection, already uncertain, has been thrown into further disarray by a parade of negative decisions.0 The parade began with a strongly worded United States Court of Appeals decision in 2003 criticizing thirty years of federal appellate precedent that provided limited protection to journalists and sources.7 The Seventh Circuits 2003 opinion accused other federal courts of badly misreading Branzburg, which the three-judge panel said provided no support for any type of constitutional privilege.8 The Seventh Circuits McKevitt opinion indicated that more than thirty years after Branzburg was decided, lower courts still were unsure what it meant. Although the passage of a federal shield law would help clarify journalists right to conceal confidential sources, it would still leave unresolved two other issues that are associated with Branzburg - the extent to which press newsgathering activities are protected by the First Amendment and the reach of generally applicable laws into newsgathering and publication. Because Branzburg still matters to the media, this article will attempt to make sense of it by using a comprehensive approach. All Supreme Court opinions that have cited Branzburg in First Amendment contexts will be examined, as well as a few non-media cases in which the Court discussed Branzburg at some length. Also, the article will briefly examine federal and state appellate court cases and federal trial court opinions that discussed Branzburgs meaning to some extent. The goal is to gain a complete picture of how this pivotal case in First Amendment law has affected press rights. Part II: Origins of the Case The cases consolidated in Branzburg v. Hayes had origins in many years of journalistic practice, centuries of Anglo-American legal tradition, and the turbulent 1960s. sl Before examining the backgrounds of the specific cases, it would be helpful to briefly sketch the larger issues at stake. THE PROBLEM OF PRIVILEGE It has long been a maxim of English and American law that privileges excusing people from providing evidence in court are disfavored because they hamper the search for truth. Famously, during a debate on whether privileges to excuse witnesses should be curtailed, Lord Hardwicke in 1742 said on the floor of Parliament that \"the public has a right to every mans evidence\" in courts of law.10 That phrase has survived to this day as a description of Anglo-American laws attitude toward privileges.11 Nevertheless, it also is widely accepted in the law that some relationships between persons are irreparably damaged if one party cannot rely on promises of confidentiality from the other. ‚Ä¶', '2010', 5, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+media+sketch+created+powell&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 3),
('trump+media+sketch+created+powell', 5, 'Middle East X-ray factory is a source of hope', '', 'Even as the United States bombed Vietnam and the Red Army quashed an uprising in Czechoslovakia, there was a place where citizens from the two cold-war superpowers could meet: the CERN cafeteria. To this day, the same spot at Europe‚Äôs particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, is a rare venue for Pakistani and Indian physicists to have a coffee, or for engineers from Israel and Iran to share ideas ‚Äî no doubt fuelled by the huge lunches and inspiring views. There is no better cure for cross-border acrimony than meeting someone from the other country and realizing that they are not so different from yourself. And major science facilities, whose inhabitants already share many beliefs, such as in openness and the scientific method, are natural places to kindle such mutual understanding. What a chance, then, for SESAME. Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East is a venture that brings together Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey, to build the region‚Äôs first synchrotron-light facility near Amman in Jordan. Proposed in 1997, modelled on CERN and created under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2002, the remarkable collaboration is now set to open (see page 475). SESAME has struggled at every turn. Several member states have made only partial payments, and its opening has been delayed by more than five years owing to financial difficulties. Other hurdles were less predictable: 2009 and 2010 saw Iranian council members assassinated, and in 2013, the facility‚Äôs roof fell in after unprecedented snowfall. But SESAME has also ridden on a wave of generosity and perseverance. Its director and various advisers contribute their time for free. Facilities in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and Switzerland have donated crucial parts of the machine, and Jordan, which provided land for the site at no cost, has continued to cough up funding, even as the neighbouring Syrian war has brought huge numbers of refugees across its borders. To get this far is a terrific success. But when it opens next year, the facility will have just two beamlines, rather than a planned four, and will be without an administration building, dormitory, major library, auditorium or visitor centre. Nor, sadly, will SESAME have its hub of scientific life, a cafeteria. Experimental equipment takes priority, but in a facility where time is so precious that researchers allotted 24 hours of beam time barely sleep, some worry that, with nowhere to grab a coffee and a seat, scientists from conflicting countries may pass like ships in the night. A group from the Sharing Knowledge Foundation in Geneva is trying to raise ‚Ç¨30,000 (US$32,000) through public donations by the end of this year towards creating a SESAME cafeteria. But funds for both the cafe and the science could also come from another source, which has been conspicuously lacking over the years: the United States. A Congress ruling in 2011 cut funding to UNESCO, after the organization formally recognized Palestine as a member state. This is a public-relations difficulty for SESAME, even though there should be no official block because it is independent from UNESCO. A bigger question could be whether the incoming US president meddles with the Iran nuclear deal, which could restore sanctions. Still, brokering peace in the Middle East is something that Donald Trump said on the campaign trail he‚Äôd ‚Äúreally like to do‚Äù. For less than the cost of a return flight to Tel Aviv on Air Force One, his administration could help SESAME to develop from a bare-bones scientific laboratory into a true beacon of peace and cooperation. ‚ñ† data sets can be useful? How can they be managed? What‚Äôs the best way to win the confidence of public and regulators? And, crucially, is academia training enough mathematicians and medical-data scientists, who will have to develop and harness all this new potential? The last of these questions at least has a clear answer: no. Big data sets in medicine include genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics (which, respectively, describe our genomes, identify which of our genes are being expressed and catalogue all of the proteins in a tissue sample). Genomic data sets alone have already shown their value. The presence or absence of a particular gene variant can put people in highor low-risk groups for various diseases and identify in some cases which people with cancer are likely to respond to certain drugs. But a single molecular data set will not contain sufficient information to tell the whole story of an individual‚Äôs medical fate. Integration of different types of molecular data might tell more, but that remains a computational challenge. Even more would emerge if an individual‚Äôs molecular data were placed in the context of their physiology, behaviour and health. Electronic health records, the numbers of which are skyrocketing, could be useful here. So could disease registries, hospital and health-insurance records, as well as research publications and clinical-trial data. New types of data set come from wearables and apps, which collect health data directly from individuals, and from genome sequences of volunteers. Some researchers are even trying to extract medically relevant data from social-media platforms such as Twitter. This adds up to a mind-boggling volume of data. According to one estimate at the workshop, clinical data from a single individual will generate 0.4 terabytes of information per lifetime, genomics data around 6 terabytes and additional data, 1,100 terabytes. By 2020, the amount of health-related data gathered in total will double every 73 days. Health professionals will confront more data than do those in finance. To collect and hold all of this information within strict privacy regulations ‚Äî non-negotiable for medical data ‚Äî is another challenge. Some tech firms, such as IBM Watson Health and Hewlett-Packard, are building systems that keep data local ‚Äî algorithms can dip into them, but the data are not transmitted anywhere else. Google, unsurprisingly, thinks that all these data are safer on the Cloud. The big question for scientists is how to take the next step to convert these artistic sketches of potential into scientific knowledge. Data sets vary in their reliability. Those derived from skimming social media will be very messy and will have to prove their usefulness. And large data sets, reliable or not, inevitably throw up spurious correlations, and so recognizing meaningful patterns requires deep understanding of biology, something that software developers don‚Äôt generally have. Future biologists ‚Äî funders and universities should note ‚Äî will need much more training in mathematics and data science. Big data has the exciting potential to allow clinical trials to be conducted partly in silico ‚Äî which would mean using fewer animals in drug testing as well as recruiting fewer patients to the actual trials. Yet the field is developing at a time when public trust in experts is at an all-time low. Regulators are ready to be persuaded to accept computational information in clinical trials. On occasion, the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration already accept it in pharmacokinetics, one of the simplest data sets that drug developers must supply agencies with. But the trust of doctors, patients and regulators in the abstract informatics and mathematical know-how that go into developing scientific and clinical predictions cannot be taken for granted. As medics and researchers nudge the field gradually from poetry and seduction to delivery, they must engage the next generation of scientists ‚Äî and the public ‚Äî and inform and educate them in the art and science of what is possible. ‚ñ† ‚ÄúHealth professionals will confront more data than do those in finance.‚Äù', '2016', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+media+sketch+created+powell&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 3),

In Portugal, HPV vaccination is available in either bivalent (genotypes 6, 18) or tetravalent (6, 11, 16 e 18) vaccines. Both have aluminum as an adjuvant, a substance arguably capable of inducing inflammatory adjuvant syndromes. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) mostly afflicts women of childbearing age, the very target population for HPV vaccination.

Rattan, K. Richards, Zackery A. G. Knowlden, A. Sant', 'Most current and new influenza vaccine candidates consist of a single influenza virus protein or combinations of influenza virus proteins. For these vaccines to elicit CD4+ T cells that can be recalled after infection, the peptide epitopes should be shared between the two modes of confrontation. Recently, questions regarding the relatedness of epitope selection by influenza virus infection and protein vaccination have been raised. However, the studies reported here show that the specificity of CD4+ T cells elicited by protein-based vaccines overlaps that of T cells elicited by infection and that CD4+ T cells primed by protein vaccines are recalled and contribute to protection of the host from a future infection. ABSTRACT Vaccination is widely used to generate protective immunity against influenza virus. CD4+ T cells contribute in diverse ways to protective immunity, most notably, in the provision of help for the production of neutralizing antibodies. Several recent reports have suggested that influenza virus infection elicits CD4+ T cells whose specificity only partially overlaps that of T cells elicited by vaccination. This finding has raised serious concerns regarding the utility of currently licensed inactivated influenza virus vaccines and novel protein-based vaccines. Here, using controlled animal models that allowed a broad sampling of the CD4+ T cell repertoire, we evaluated protein vaccine- versus infection-generated CD4+ T cell epitopes. Our studies revealed that all the infection-elicited CD4+ T cell epitope specificities are also elicited by protein vaccination, although the immunodominance hierarchies can differ. Finally, using a reverse-engineered influenza virus and a heterologous protein vaccination and infection challenge strategy, we show that protein vaccine-elicited CD4+ memory T cells are recalled and boosted after infection and provide early help to accelerate hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody responses. The early CD4+ T cell response and HA-specific antibody production are associated with lowered viral titers during the infection challenge. Our data lend confidence to the ability of current protein-based vaccines to elicit influenza virus-specific CD4+ T cells that can potentiate protective immunity upon influenza virus infection. IMPORTANCE Most current and new influenza vaccine candidates consist of a single influenza virus protein or combinations of influenza virus proteins.

Whilst vaccination is key for the prevention of influenza infection, there are many factors which may contribute to reduced vaccine effectiveness, including antigenic evolution via both antigenic drift and egg-adaptations. Due to the currently dissociated and indirect evidence supporting both the occurrence of these two phenomena in the egg-based manufacturing process and their effects on vaccine effectiveness, this topic remains a subject of debate.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo review the evidence and level of agreement in expert opinion supporting a mechanistic basis for reduced vaccine effectiveness due to egg-based manufacturing, using an expert consensus-based methodology and literature reviews.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTen European influenza specialists were recruited to the expert panel. The overall research question was deconstructed into four component principles, which were examined in series using a novel, online, two-stage assessment of proportional group awareness and consensus. The first stage independently generated a list of supporting references for each component principle via literature searches and expert assessments. In the second stage, a summary of each reference was circulated amongst the experts, who rated their agreement that each reference supported the component principle on a 5-point Likert scale. Finally, the panel were asked if they agreed that, as a whole, the evidence supported a mechanistic basis for reduced vaccine effectiveness due to egg-based manufacturing.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll component principles were reported to have a majority of strong or very strong supporting evidence (70-90%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOn reviewing the evidence for all component principles, experts unanimously agreed that there is a mechanistic basis for reduced vaccine effectiveness resulting from candidate influenza virus variation due to egg-based manufacturing, particularly in the influenza A/H3N2 strain.

Hepatitis B Virus Screening and Vaccination in Patients with HIV: A Survey of Physicians‚Äô Current Clinical Practices', 'Elizabeth Hastie, D. Wooten', 'Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV co-infection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but data and guidelines vary in terms of the best vaccination, re-vaccination, and monitoring practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current HBV monitoring and vaccination practices of physicians who care for patients living with HIV. Methods A Web-based survey was distributed to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Infectious Diseases division via the UCSD ID listserv, Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) members via the IDea Exchange listserv, and to ID and HIV social network members via Twitter and Facebook. The survey consisted of demographic questions followed by two sets of case-based questions. The case questions focused on type, timing, and dosage of HBV vaccination administration among people living with HIV, HBV monitoring post-vaccination, and clinical approach to patients with isolated hepatitis B core antibody. Results A total of 67 clinicians from 24 states completed the survey (Table 1). Most (55%) provide care for more than 20 patients living with HIV per month. The majority of participants (82%) would not defer HBV vaccination until HIV virologic suppression. Almost half of participants (43%) indicated they would use Heplisav-B over older HBV vaccine formulations (Energix-B or Recombivax-HB) for initial vaccination of susceptible patients. The majority (88%) would repeat a vaccination series if the patient does not seroconvert; 23% would repeat with a standard dose series of Energix-B or Recombivax-HB, 24% with a double dose series of Energix-B or Recombivax-HB, and 45% would repeat with Heplisav-B. Approach to management of a patient living with HIV with isolated hepatitis B core antibody was varied. The majority would check a HBV DNA level (42%), while 25% would initiate a vaccination series and 24% would not pursue further intervention (Table 2).

Picchio, Mireia G. Carrasco, M. Sagu√©-Vilavella, C. Rius', 'Background Healthcare professionals are a reliable and impactful source of information on vaccination for parents and children. Objectives We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs primary care professionals involved in administration of childhood vaccines in Barcelona have about vaccines and vaccination. Methods In 2016/17, surveys were administered in person to every public primary care centre (PCC) with a paediatrics department (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ41). Paediatricians and paediatric nurses responded to questions about disease susceptibility, severity, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine safety, confidence in organisations, key immunisation beliefs, and how they vaccinate or would vaccinate their own children. We used standard descriptive analysis to examine the distribution of key outcome and predictor variables and performed bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results Completed surveys were returned by 277 (81%) of 342 eligible participants. A quarter of the respondents reported doubts about at least one vaccine in the recommended childhood vaccination calendar. Those with vaccine doubts chose the response option ‚Äòvaccine-hesitant‚Äô for every single key vaccine belief, knowledge and social norm. Specific vaccine knowledge was lacking in up to 40% of respondents and responses regarding the human papilloma virus vaccine were associated with the highest degree of doubt. Being a nurse a risk factor for having vaccine doubts (adjusted odds ratio (ORa)‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ2.0; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.1‚Äì3.7) and having children was a predictor of lower risk (ORa‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.5; 95% CI: 0.2‚Äì0.9). Conclusions Despite high reported childhood immunisation rates in Barcelona, paediatricians and paediatric nurses in PCC had vaccine doubts, especially regarding the HPV vaccine.', '2019', 16, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=virus+questions+question+reported+reports+reportedly+vaccines+vaccine+vaccination+theory+theories&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 4);

Su, D. McDonnell, Jun Wen, Ali Cheshmehzangi, Junaid Ahmad, Edmund Goh, Xiaoshan Li, Sabina ≈†egalo, M. Mackert, Y. Xiang, Pei-Hong Wang', 'Background Health campaign interventions, particularly those tailored to the target audience‚Äôs needs and preferences, can cost-effectively change people‚Äôs attitudes and behaviors towards better health decision-making. However, there is limited research on how to best tailor seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns for young adults. Vaccination is vital in protecting young adults and their social circles (vulnerable populations like older adults) from the influenza virus and critical in shaping these emerging adults‚Äô vaccination habits in the long run. However, amid the prevalence of easily-accessible, attention-grabbing, and often malicious false and misinformation (e.g., COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories), it may be more challenging to develop vaccination messages that resonate with young adults well enough to attract their attention. Therefore, to bridge the research gap, this study examines young adults‚Äô preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns to inform effective intervention design and development. Methods Qualitative survey questions were developed to gauge young adults‚Äô preferences for seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. A total of 545 young adults (73.9% female, Mage = 19.89, SD = 1.44) from a large University offered complete answers to a cross-sectional online survey. Braun and Clarke‚Äôs thematic analysis procedures were adopted to guide the data analysis process. Results Thematic analysis revealed that young adults prefer seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns that rely on (1) quality and balanced information from (2) credible information sources, positioned in the (3) relevant health contexts, (4) emphasize actionable messages, and incorporate (5) persuasive campaign design. Interestingly, while many participants underscored the importance of fear-appeal messages in persuading them to take health actions, some young adults also suggested avoiding fear campaigns due to discomfort. Conclusions Insights of the study can inform seasonal influenza vaccination design and development, and have the potential to shed light on vaccination messaging in other vaccine contexts, such as COVID-19 vaccines. Results also underscore the need for health experts and government officials to adopt a more nuanced approach when selecting persuasive campaign appeals. While some young adults may resonate well with fear appeals, others may not. Future research could examine the underlying mechanisms that drive young adults‚Äô preference for vaccination campaign intervention to enrich the literature further.', '2021', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=virus+questions+question+reported+reports+reportedly+vaccines+vaccine+vaccination+theory+theories&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 4),

Hayward, R. Aldridge, Virus Watch Collaborative', 'Objectives - To assess trends in intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine between 1 December 2020 and 25 February 2021, explore associations between socio-demographic factors and vaccination intention and investigate how COVID-19 vaccine- and illness-related attitudes, beliefs and emotions influence vaccination intention. Design - Prospective household community cohort study of COVID-19 infection (Virus Watch). Setting - Online survey of Virus Watch study participants in the community across England and Wales. Participants - Individuals could enrol in Virus Watch if all household members agreed to participate and at least one household member had access to the internet, an email address, and could read English. All Virus Watch participants aged 16 years and over who responded to questions relating to COVID-19 vaccine intention in questionnaires between December 2020 and February 2021 were included in this analysis. Main outcome measures - Vaccination intention was measured by individual participant responses to \"Would you accept a COVID-19 vaccine if offered?\", collected between 1-14 December 2020 and 17-25 February 2021. Possible responses were \"Yes\", \"No\" and \"Unsure\" (December 2020 & February 2021) and \"Already had a COVID-19 vaccine\" (February 2021 only). Responses to a 13-item questionnaire collected between 4-11 January 2021 were analysed using factor analysis to investigate psychological influences (attitudes, beliefs and emotions) on vaccination intention. Results - Survey response rate was 56% (20,792/36,998) in December 2020 and 52% (20,284/38,727) in February 2021, with 14,713 adults reporting across both time points. Of participants reporting across both timepoints, 13,281 (90%) answered \"Yes\" and 1,432 (10%) responded \"No\" or \"Unsure\" in December 2020. Of those answering \"No\" or \"Unsure\" in December 2020, 1,233 (86%) went on to answer \"Yes\" or \"Already had a COVID-19 vaccine\" in February 2021. The magnitude of this shift was consistent across all ethnic groups measured and all levels of social deprivation. Age was most strongly associated with vaccination intention, with 16-24-year-olds more likely to respond \"No\" or \"Unsure\" than those aged 75+ in December 2020 (RR: 4.32, 95% CI: 2.40-7.78 & 2.93 95% CI: 2.19-3.92, respectively) and February 2021 (RR: 5.30 95% CI: 1.39-20.20 & 20.21 95%CI: 7.19-56.78). The association between ethnicity and vaccination intention has weakened, but not disappeared, over time. Both vaccine- and illness-related psychological factors were shown to influence vaccination intention. Conclusions - Over four in five adults (86%) who were reluctant or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020 had changed their mind in February 2021 and planned on accepting, or had already accepted, a vaccine.', '2021', 8, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=virus+questions+question+reported+reports+reportedly+vaccines+vaccine+vaccination+theory+theories&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 4),

Crowcroft', 'Background In settings where measles has been eliminated, vaccine-derived immunity may in theory wane more rapidly due to a lack of immune boosting by circulating measles virus. We aimed to assess whether measles vaccine effectiveness (VE) waned over time, and if so, whether differentially in measles-eliminated and measles-endemic settings. Methods We performed a systematic literature review of studies that reported VE and time since vaccination with measles-containing vaccine (MCV). We extracted information on case definition (clinical symptoms and/or laboratory diagnosis), method of vaccination status ascertainment (medical record or vaccine registry), as well as any biases which may have arisen from cold chain issues and a lack of an age at first dose of MCV. We then used linear regression to evaluate VE as a function of age at first dose of MCV and time since MCV. Results After screening 14,782 citations, we identified three full-text articles from measles-eliminated settings and 33 articles from measles-endemic settings. In elimination settings, two-dose VE estimates increased as age at first dose of MCV increased and decreased as time since MCV increased; however, the small number of studies available limited interpretation. In measles-endemic settings, one-dose VE increased by 1.5% (95% CI 0.5, 2.5) for every month increase in age at first dose of MCV. We found no evidence of waning VE in endemic settings. Conclusions The paucity of data from measles-eliminated settings indicates that additional studies and approaches (such as studies using proxies including laboratory correlates of protection) are needed to answer the question of whether VE in measles-eliminated settings wanes. Age at first dose of MCV was the most important factor in determining VE. More VE studies need to be conducted in elimination settings, and standards should be developed for information collected and reported in such studies.', '2019', 14, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=virus+questions+question+reported+reports+reportedly+vaccines+vaccine+vaccination+theory+theories&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 4),

After taking a seat at a large table, I noticed that no one seemed to want to sit next to me. As more people shuffled in, most of my labmates huddled on the opposite side of the table. Someone mentioned the ‚Äúkung flu.‚Äù Another labmate ‚Äújoked‚Äù that Asians really ought to be wearing masks, especially in small gatherings such as lab meetings. It took me a few moments to realize that‚Äîas the only Asian person in the room‚Äîthey were likely talking about me. I know I should have been wearing a mask, but I wasnt the only person in the room without one.\n\n\n\n> ‚ÄúRacist comments ‚Ä¶ should not be normalized and tolerated.‚Äù \n\nA few days before that, I was sitting in the buildings atrium with a Black colleague discussing an experimental method when a scientist from another lab joined us.

Our visitor went on to declare that looting is not the right solution to George Floyds killing, that people need to get jobs instead of protesting all day, and that Black people shouldnt be so angry all the time. We sat there, appalled, but didnt say anything.\n\nOn another occasion, a former co-worker asked me‚Äîas an immigrant‚Äîhow I felt about President Donald Trumps immigration bans. I said I wished immigrants werent constantly viewed as a threat to the economy because we have so much to offer, particularly in niche work sectors. The persons response was along the lines of, ‚ÄúAt least Silicon Valley will be less of a ‚Äòbrown town‚Äô and give others a chance.‚Äù I laughed but felt seriously uncomfortable.\n\nWhy didnt I speak up? Because I feared repercussions‚Äîand Im sure Im not alone in feeling that way. On the rare occasions when I have voiced my concern about racist comments, Ive been told I am ‚Äútoo much of a social justice warrior.‚Äù Im at a precarious point in my training, because Im currently doing lab rotations, and I will settle on a Ph.D. adviser next year.

('said+ap+immigration+immigrant+immigrants+wear+wearing', 3, 'How Mexican Cartels Are Changing the Face of Immigration', 'Sylvia Longmire', 'One could argue that Ecuadorian immigrant Luis Fredy Lala Pomavilla is lucky to be alive. In August 2010, Luis and seventy-two other migrants from Central and South America were traveling north through Mexico in the back of two freight trucks. Some had paid up to USD 10,000 for safe passage to Texas through eastern Mexico, believing their coyotes, or paid human smugglers, knew this to be the safest route. Unfortunately, this route would take them through Tamaulipas state, the bloody battlefield of the rival Gulf and Los Zetas drug cartels.At some point in the afternoon, the trucks were about nine miles north of the town of San Fernando-roughly ninety miles from the border with Texas-on Highway 101 when they came across a roadblock. Armed men wearing facemasks emerged from three vehicles parked across the road and identified themselves as members of Los Zetas. The men ordered all the migrants out of the freight trucks, put them into several pickup trucks, and took them to a warehouse on an abandoned ranch nearby. In all, fifty-eight men and fourteen women were lined up against a wall in the warehouse and interrogated about where they came from, where they were going, what they did for a living, and if they worked for the Gulf Cartel. All of them denied having any links to trafficking organizations.1Not completely satisfied with their answers, the leader of the group, nicknamed \"El Kilo,\" offered the migrants one last chance: they could work for Los Zetas as forced labor. All of them refused. In response to their refusal, the captors ordered the migrants to lie face down on the ground, then executed them with several rounds from assault rifles. To ensure everyone was dead, the men delivered a final shot into the head of every migrant. However, one of those coup de gr√¢ce shots went astray and caught Luis in the neck instead of in the head. Despite being in a massive amount of pain from the bullet that exited through his jaw, he played dead until his captors left the ranch.2Luis managed to travel several miles to a Mexican Marine checkpoint, where he told the soldiers what happened. Once the Marines made it to the site of the massacre, they discovered the seventy-two bodies exactly as Luis had described. They also seized twenty-one firearms and detained a minor, most likely associated with the cartel.3 El Kilo and his people avoided the Marine raid, and hid out in nearby Ciudad Victoria for several months. However, he and eleven of his accomplices were arrested in April 2011, although his boss, Salvador \"La Ardilla\" Martinez, remained at large.4This massacre is just one example in which Mexican cartels are changing the nature of northbound human migration in Latin America. Los Zetas, in particular, are increasingly preying on vulnerable immi- grants, viewing them as a potential source of ransom money or forced labor. But Los Zetas are certainly not the only drug trafficking group involved in reaping the profits of the human smuggling business. A report by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars stated, \"Factions of many [organized crime groups] engage in similar activities, either directly or indirectly. The Gulf Cartel appears to be the most active, and works with both the Mexican police and Mexican migration officials in order to capture its victims.\" It also said, \"Factions of the Juarez and Tijuana cartels also collect piso [a tax, or toll] from local smugglers and may, in the case of Juarez, be directly involved in trafficking. Portions of the old La Familia Michoacana, now called the Caballeros Templarios (the Knights Templar), and the Sinaloa Cartel have also report- edly displaced coyotes operating in their territories and have attempted to take over this business.\"5Acclaimed journalist and producer for Al Jazeera America, Christof Putzel discovered this first-hand while filming a documentary for the now- defunct Current TVs Vanguard series. In November 2010, Putzel and Mexican-American filmmaker Juan Carlos Frey recorded their attempt to smuggle themselves across the southwest border in a manner as close as possible to that of hundreds of thousands of migrants every year. ‚Ä¶', '2014', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ap+immigration+immigrant+immigrants+wear+wearing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 5),

Darden', 'School is open, or opening, for all schoolchildren in America. But for children of undocumented immigrants, that yearly ritual is not always so simple. Perhaps one of the greatest yearnings in the human heart is the need to secure an unshakeable sense of belonging. Americans flaunt group membership by wearing red, white, and blue lapel pins, flying Old Glory on the front porch, cheering the USA World Cup soccer team, and singing the \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Still, such unrelenting patriotism masks an ironic bias that goes something like this: Undocumented immigrants go home. However, consider the fate of public school students who fit that category. Barring the door to learning is not only reprehensible but illegal. Federal courts have declared emphatically that the U.S. Constitution protects undocumented youth, guaranteeing them the same public education as everyone else. In short, they also belong. Since 2000, the number of immigrants has exploded, with travelers from Mexico and Latin American countries leading the way. The growth has been particularly acute in so-called new gateway states in the South and Midwest. This has created challenges for school systems. Among them are the need to ramp up new English language learner classes, reconcile cultural disconnects, or accommodate mobile populations. The first step is the school office during registration. School officials cannot ask the parent or child their immigration status. The singular obligation is to accept the registration and place the student into the pipeline like anyone else in the community. That said, there is nothing barring schools from demanding proof of residency. Equal rights The 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe established the right for undocumented students to be admitted to public schools. The Texas legislature passed a law in 1975 to withhold state funds from children not \"legally admitted\" to the United States. That statute also allowed local school districts to reject students on the same grounds. A group of Mexican children challenged the practice in the Tyler Independent School District. Applying the 14th Amendments equal protection clause, then-Justice William Brennan, wrote, \"This situation raises the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, encouraged by some to remain here as a source of cheap labor but nevertheless denied the benefits that our society makes available to citizens and lawful residents. The existence of such an underclass presents most difficult problems for a nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law.\" Justice Brennan added, \"Obviously, no child is responsible for his birth and penalizing the ... child is an ineffectual--as well as unjust--way of deterring the parent.\" Barring the door to learning is not only reprehensible but illegal. Plyler forbids K-12 officials from making inquiries that expose immigration status, requiring social security numbers, or engaging in other behaviors designed to reveal illegality. School districts can therefore accept foreign birth certificates or other international forms of identification. The high court made clear that school officials have no role in enforcing immigration law. That message was reinforced last spring when the U.S. Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice released a joint guidance letter (along with a fact sheet and a separate question and answers document) reminding school districts of their responsibility to prevent discrimination against undocumented immigrant children. Upon release, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said exclusionary practices \"not only harm innocent children, they also markedly weaken our nation ... by leaving young people unprepared and ill-equipped to succeed and contribute to what is, in many cases, the only home they have ever known. ‚Ä¶', '2014', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ap+immigration+immigrant+immigrants+wear+wearing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 5),

The short story Montreal 1962 is an excursion into the lives of two Indians in a foreign land and their attempt to establish identity in the face of a competing and hostile alien culture. The loss of cultural symbols is visible at different levels in the story which in return brings forth a clash between the two different cultures. This kind of tension or clash between migrants and natives is a universal phenomenon in the era of migration. Keywords‚ÄîCultural clash, Sikh, Turban. A nation‚Äôs cultural memory carries its wars, victories, defeats, martyrdoms and symbols. That is, the identity of a community or a religious group hinges on access to its past. No religious group or nation comes into existence without a discourse of belonging. This discourse includes myths, stories, shared icons and cultural symbols from where a social group takes its identity. These signs and symbols empower them with a sense of being united under a unified identity. Let‚Äôs take the example of Sikh religion, a Sikh can be recognized in any country just from h is turban and full grown beard and even a Muslim can be traced from his cultural symbols. In the era of immigrat ion people live in the scattered forms all over the world but these icons and cultural symbols bring them together, bring them into contact, at least symbolically, with other people in the different places. This collective sharing of icons and symbols generates the emotional connection es sential to form a coherent identity. Identity is a symbolic matter‚Äîa meaning attached to a person, or which he is able to attach to himself, with the help of responses of others. Disturb these responses, disturb these meanings, and you disturb the man. A society fails to supply adequate identity when symbols are disturbed to the extent that they no longer give reliable reference points (in such things as status symbols, place symbols, style models, cultic mystiques) by which people can locate themselves socially , realise themselves emotionally, and declare (to self and others) who they are. The search for identity has been not only tedious but wrong headed, because it has never been clearly established what sort of identity could be expected in a bilingual, multi-cu ltural, p luralistic society. The question of identity in modern society has broadly been approached at three levels involving the dimensions of national identity, regional identity and indiv idual or personal identity. Quite often these dimens ions convey different meanings to different people, for some it is simply a deep sense of loyalty to, or pride in, ones native land, whereas for other it takes the form of a well articulated polit ical philosophy, encompassing the overriding goals of the policies of the nation state. Well-known contemporary polit ical theorist of nationalism, national and ethnic diversity, Montserrat Guibernau argues ‚ÄúNational identity is currently one of the most powerful forms of collective identity. National identity is based upon the sentiment of belonging to a specific nation, endowed with its own symbols, traditions, sacred places, ceremonies, heroes, history, culture and territory‚Äù.(Catalan Nationalism 152). She asserts that a common national identity favours the creation of solidarity bonds among the members of a given community and allows them to imagine the community they belong to as separate and distinct from others. These others can be people belonging to other nation-states or minority ethnic, religious or linguistic communit ies within the same nation-state. At the same time, the indiv iduals who enter a culture emot ionally charge certain symbols, values, beliefs and customs by internalizing them and conceiving them as part of themselves while rejecting others as alien and enemy attributes. In this sense the identities ‚Äúact as mechanisms of social inclusion and exclusion, creating imaginary limits between those who belong and those who do not belong to specific communities‚Äù (Catalan Nationalism 3). International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences (IJELS) Vol-4, Issue-2, Mar Apr, 2019 https://dx.doi.org/10.22161/ijels.4.2.36 ISSN: 2456-7620 www.ijels.com Page | 438 In Montreal 1962, an immigrant woman and her husband come to Canada in search of a sound financial identity. They are lured by the officials of the Canadian embassy in India who had praised them as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a well-qualified man. We need professional people.‚Äù And they talked about freedom and opportunity for those lucky enough to already speak English....exot ic new Canadians, new blood to build a new country. (Baldwin, English Lessons 16). The identity of women is a central issue of discussion in the femin istic criticism. The identity for Diasporic women perpetuates through the complexity of combined plurality in the singular self. They try to explore the roots in out-ofreach native land which dominates their memories. On one hand women have to gain their separate identity in the male dominated culture by breaking its norms and conventions and on the other hand they try to maintain their cultural identity by retaining the cultural patterns. The story presents the predicament of a sikh wife liv ing with her husband in Canada where her husband is asked to take off h is turban and cut his hair short to have the job. These turbans carry so much cultural and religious affiliation and affection in the life of a Sikh. Here turban is a symbol of strong religious identity, loss of turban means loss of identity: ‚ÄúThey said I could have the job if I take off my turban and cut my hair short‚Äù (Baldwin, English Lessons 17) Even his counterpart is more concerned with his identity than her own because in India a woman is considered to be the part of her husband‚Äôs identity. She has never seen her father, her brother and her husband without a turban. But, these turbans appear to be bed-sheets or curtains to the Canadian dry-cleaner woman without eyebrows. The Canadians in a way t ry to force her husband to sacrifice his cultural identity and tradition to adopt the new world: ‚ÄúYou must be reborn white-skinned ‚Äì and clean-shaven to show it ‚Äì to survive.‚Äù(Baldwin, English Lessons 15) If the cultural symbols (sari, turban etc) are being challenged by the society it means loss of ind ividuality and identity and also a sense of loss of belongingness. This situation is often faced by immigrants and is a common phenomenon. This is very clear from the conversation with the neighbourhood dry cleaner and the protagonist who brought a wedding sari for dry cleaning: ---she asked me , ‚ÄúIs it a bed sheet?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äô‚Äô I said. ‚ÄúCurtains?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù(Baldwin, English Lessons 16) The detailed description of the process of washing, drying, folding and wearing the turbans focuses on the love and attachment of a sikh woman towards turban. Turban possesses a strong cultural importance for the Sikh community. For the protagonist the red colour of a turban stands for the blood of the Sikh gurus and martyrs: I unfurled the gauzy scarlet on our bed and it seemed as though I‚Äôd poured a pool of the sainted blood of all the Sikh martyrs there. (Baldwin, English Lessons 17) Tying of turban by woman protagonist reminds her of the cultural heritage of her sikh community: In the mirror I saw my father as he must have looked as a boy, my teenage brother as I remember him, you as you face Canada, myself as I need to be.

Bhabha, and GayatriChakravortySpivak contributed to postcolonialism and the postcolonial intellectuals has developed a new perspective whereby the conditions of marginality, subalterneity, plurality, mimicry, hybridity are seen as sources of energy and potential change.Many women writers, thinkers and critics have formulated a school of thought that searches for such instances in literature. Feminist literary criticism primarily responds to the way woman is presented in literature. Postcolonial feminist criticism examines how women are represented in colonial and postcolonial literature and challenges assumptions which are made about women in both literature and society. Postcolonial feminists point out the ways in which women continue to be stereotyped and marginalised, ironically sometimes by postcolonial authors who might claim to be challenging a culture of oppression. The main task of the feminist literary critics seems to oppose patriarchal norms which exist in the society. The marginalizations of women, their predicament, struggle for identity, finding their own space, celebrating the female body are the chief subjects of this trend. The protagonists of all the novels of ManjuKapur are seen as women struggling against all odds. ManjuKapur has always tried to depict the picture of the sufferings of women at deeper level in her novels.In her novels, she deals with the problems of women and their struggle to establish an identity. She in particular takes up the cause of the females who are victimized on account of conservative and traditional mind-set of the Indian masses.Most of the protagonists of Kapur are women who assert their rights and raise voice against male chauvinism.Nina is one such character who rebels against the exploitation and oppression to assert her individuality. ¬© 2016 Elixir All rights reserved.

Finally Nina is married to a Canada based Indian dentist, Ananda. The mother like all other Indian mothers is now relieved of the burden of her unmarried daughter.Nina after marrying Ananda, reaches Halifax, Canada. She arrives in Canada with an expectation of a happy married life but to her dismay, she finds herself defenseless. She lacks the warmth of passion and eventually walks out of the nuptial bond. In the beginning Ananda takes care of Nina with respect and affection, and makes sure that she is comfortable when she arrives in Canada. However, as the story unfolds, Ananda tries to dominate her physically and financially and subtle patriarchal side to Ananda emerges as he tries to decide Nina‚Äôs dress, eating, name, sexual practices, and even her desire to have children. When Nina wants to wear traditional dresses like saris and salwarkhameezes and she believes that her traditional wears help her to relate her identity as an Indian woman. But Ananda asks Nina to stop wearing her saris everywhere as they are too formal. Being a vegetarian when Nina comes to know that Ananda eats meat she is slightly shocked because according to her she feels that Indian culture is represented in the vegetarian food. So she feels betrayed by Ananda but compromises by cooking separately for them. She cooks Canadian cuisine and meat for Ananda and vegetarian meals for her.But Ananda continues to suggest throughout the story that Nina‚Äüs life would be much more exciting and easy in Canada if she is ready to eat meat. Ananda is happy that to Nina‚Äôs advantage her name can be Indian as well as western and thus suits well in Canada. Ananda, being the only earning partner, controls the finances and pays the bills. On one occasion Nina spends three hundred dollars on clothes, western clothes which he encouraged her to buy. However, upon receipt of the bill, he gets very angry at her expenditure. Knowing that Nina has no proper income of her own, he continues to make her feel guilty for spending his money and continues to control her expenses. If a woman does not have any money of her own, it then restricts various other aspects of her life that involve certain expenses. She can thus be confined physically and financially. Nina is shattered when she comes to know about her husband‚Äôs sexual problem of premature ejaculation and she feels quite helpless as she could not get pregnant. When Nina suggests if they could see a fertility specialist, after many failed attempts at trying to conceive, he justifies his noncooperation by stating that it was still too early for them in their marriage and that there was no rush. It is an example of how he controls and dominates her. Ananda wants to decide everything for Nina starting from her dress to her desire to have a child. As a result a gradual rift is born between the couple. Arguments, blame, guilt, indifference and ultimately infidelity create a much different atmosphere within their marriage than that of the beginning. Nina feels lifeless without a child and isolated without a job. Even though she spends her time at her will, she finds herself lonely and bored. She cries, ‚ÄúI miss homeI miss a job I miss doing things. I feel like a shadow. What am I but your wife ?‚Äù(Kapur, p.237) Nina‚Äôs feeling of loss takes her to a group of women who work on feminist principles. Her distress resulting from her being without job in Canada and also her failure in conceiving make her to wail before Beth. ‚ÄúEverything is very strange‚Äù, she said in a rush, ‚ÄúI used to be a teacher, in fact I taught for ten years before I came here. And now I do nothing. I have not even been able to conceive. (Kapur, p.232) Eventually she tries to overcome loneliness by engaging herself in various work. She buys books from the grocery shop to fill her time. But reading books also fails to distract her. It seems her mundane and boring. She, in order to find herself out, begins to wear jeans. She joins a library course so that she could remain engaged. But here she enters into an extramarital relationship with Anton, a fellow student, which ends on a date rape. Nina feels guilty after the first sexual encounter and she begins to ponder what she had done. But soon she rationalizes herself when she says that she has done what she likes. She thinks ‚ÄúThat she like, she had lived. Who can feel guilty about living ? Judging from the evidence, and the sexual therapy centers, every citizen in North America regarded good sex as their unalienable right. It was her right too‚Äù (Kapur, p.263). As the story proceeds Nina feels tainted by her own infidelity withAnton and she decides to eat fish, and meat. ‚ÄúAfter she had sex with Anton, it seemed especially hypocritical to hang on to vegetables‚Äù(Kapur, p.267). She thus compares her fidelity and vegetarianism to all that is pure and Indian, and her infidelity and eating of meat to that which is tainted and un-Indian. Her disappointment with the sexual relationship between Ananda and her, the lack of intimacy on his part and lack of orgasm on hers, the inability for them to conceive, all lead to Nina‚Äôs change in expectations of who she has to be as an Indian woman and the promising expectations of a happy married life. Kapur depicts very easily how agirl from India migrates to Canada and how her traditional dress sari is replaced with jeans andT-shirt and how she starts eating meat in her food which was so difficult for her earlier. She isnot hesitant in being adultery but later she doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy this relation. At the end when she discovers Ananda‚Äôs infidelity, it becomes clear that their marriage ‚Äúwas based on more than one person‚Äôs lies‚Äù (Kapur, p.32', '2016', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ap+immigration+immigrant+immigrants+wear+wearing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 5),

Kirschbaum', 'The idea that increasing immigration will lead to a growing Muslim presence in Western Europe and that this in turn stands in contrast to the secularity of these states frames the context of this study. Therefore, this thesis explores the experiences of religious Muslims in the secular Swedish society. Potential problems between the religious Muslim minority and secular Swedish majority have been examined through a mixed method approach. This approach combined semi-structured interviews with Muslims and a logistic regression with data from Swedes. The results show that the religiosity of Muslims does not hinder their subjective integration into the Swedish society. This is especially the case for the second-generation immigrants who want to adapt to the customs of the society, which was a strong factor for Swedes to rate Muslims positively. Therefore, religion itself does not seem to be the divider between the Muslim participants and Swedes in this study. What seems to be more problematic is the general perception of Muslims as being distinct according to Swedes. This relates to the finding that Muslim women wearing the hijab were the most vulnerable to discrimination based on religion. Thus, even though the second-generation immigrants are not asking for special treatment due to their religion, take part in Swedish celebrations, speak Swedish and are part of the labour market, they still face discriminatory behaviour. The wearing of the hijab identifies them as Muslims and thus as an culturally and religiously different group. Even though they personally feel accepted, it cannot be said that integration is achieved since they remain discriminated against by the majority society due to the identification as a different group.

One way of creating an emotive is by changing the meaning of a verb or noun.

Therefore, if dressing sloppy and simple was considered inappropriate for educated girls, it became the correct fashion in the school yard.¬† Stories and pictures in textbooks describe Hebrew girls and women with simple appearances. Schools newspaper included portraits of young girls who wore ordinary clothes. Wearing earring and necklace were considered coquetry, and most of the women teachers did not wear makeup or high heels. The change in the students population as a result of a wave of immigration after the establishment of the state in 1948 forced the school to become of the foremost arenas of socialization during the first decade. More than half of all the students were immigrants, who did not share the the emotional normes of the old timers. ¬†A case study of the conflict between the emotional regime of the old timers and the emotional norms of some of the new comers was the issue of lice ridden girls hair. The emotional norm of the old timer women teachers was that body hygienic is one of the basic rules of beauty. Therefore, their emotive was cutting the girl students hair short. The emotional norm of the grilses  parents was that the splendor of a woman is her hair; cutting of a females hair impinged on her beauty. ¬†Hence,¬† the immigrant parents found themselves suffering emotively.

While if we take a look on its consequences will see that they have a dual nature. Among the positive aspects of exodus we can mention the fact that it helped Albania economically meeting the needs of a considerable part of the population in the moment of political and social crisis transition enabling the survival of many families. 1On the other hand it had a negative impact not only becouse of spending vital energies of the nation abroad, but also because it led to the formation of a bad opinion about Albanians, opinion spread almost all over Europe, especially where their presence was bigger. 2 For this reason we got to study precisely the image of immigrant in two countries ( Italy and Greece ), where they have the largest flow of migration in 1990-2000. We should note that in recent years in both countryes in Italy and in Greece prevails the same closed mentality against foreigners. Also it is accompanied ( especially in Italy with the malfunctioning of the structure that handles issues of migratory movements, not like in the other states like Germany, England or France where, besides the small number of immigrants, there were laws and better functioning of the state that associated with emigration‚Äôs problems. On the other hand we can say that in this period, whether in Greece the fortunes of the Albanian immigrants depended from the relations of the GreekAlbanian state, in Italy they depend mainly on the behavior of immigrants. 3 \" Invasion \" of embassies, mass departures at the border, and the exodus in general, following the collapse of Albania s totalitarian regime in the early 90s, and marked the origin of the formation of the Albanian Diaspora. According to the researchers R. Devole compactness of the concept of \" Albanian diaspora \", depends of homogenising effect means of mass proclamation, which as a consequence of technological developments of recent years, they can provide culturally emigrants everywhere. 4 Albanian immigrants in Greece constitute a community with different characteristics from their compatriots residing in the Unitet State of America. The differences are largely determined by relations with host countries, but also from the body, identity processes, distance from the birthplace, etc. From this perspective, the Albanian diaspora is better to be used in the plural than in the singular. 5 When the ships of Albanian exodus set sail to the coast, in Europe was waiting cameras and cameras of the whole world. Solidity of negative images of Albanians depends on the raw materials used for its manufacture : news, television footage, photographs, films, articles, interviews, analysis, documentaries, reportages, sounding titles, chronicles, etc. From this media curfew in few causes can be ‚Äúgood albanians‚Äù. 6 Fluent Italian, wearing fashionable, European faces, dignified culture, fell necessarily in conflict with the image of barbarity imparted by the media, but not to the extent as to bring in crisis the bredore coherence of the negative myth of Albanians. 7 The following years this myth on the Albanians would start to fade gradually, but without losing its shape. Thats because this period coincided with the television success of several Albanian artists, who with their ingenuity showed the opposite about the negative image of the Albanian community.

In addition, for the first time in Albanian immigration history in Italy was verified harmful racizm acts to their detriments. 1 However, there is no denying that Albanian emigrants are already an integral part of Italian society. Perhaps it is no exaggeration to say that Albanians are one of inclined groups to be integrated, as is obvious from different data like: presence in the labor market, the percentage of family with permanent residence, level of education, high school attendance, and the cultural approach and attitude. 2 This influenced perhaps because in Italy we will have a significant presence of intellectuals and cultural elite of the country, who after 90 years chose to continue their activity abroad. Although according the data the majority of them will migrate mainly in the US and in other countries in Western Europe. 3 Meanwhile, regarding the situation of Albanians in Greece in the years 1990-2000, we can not say that we have sufficient resources to present a comprehensive situation associated with their image in the media and the Greek press,but present to us the study of R. King and J. Vullnetari can say that it was similar to the Italian in many aspects. After the first welcoming, the image of Albanians was disintegrated by some stereotypes, which should be noted that constituted a small minority. But a major impact would have the historical past of the two countries after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, which would penalize in many aspects Albanian immigrants in Greece. During this period another aspect that would bring prejudice to the Albanian community,would be the differentiation of the state and the Greek society will do among the \" half etnic Greek Albanian‚Äôs \" ( mainly from areas of southern Albania ) and \" other Albanian \", which would bring differences in their rights. 4 The Common of both countries is that Albanian emigration, despite stereotypes used by the media to characterize it, has achieved a high degree of integration in the socioeconomic life of these countries. 5 About the cultural integration of Albanian emigrants in the countries where they have settled over the years 1990-2000, we can not say that in all the places he has been uneven. By the sources used by us, although in small numbers, we can see that this process is not developed with the same intensity in all countries where Albanians have emigrated. This can be explained by several reasons, among which the most important would be ; the size and compactness of the Albanian community, and in the other side the tendency of the recipient companies to allow the organization of immigrants on the basis of ethnicity, coupled with a high degree of tolerance. But on the other side the Albanian emigration can distinguish different trend. In neighboring countries such as Italy and Greece where is the concentrated and the largest number of immigrants, during the whole period of the 90s Albanians have a few cultural activitie,because of prejudices that hinder the integration in economic life. As in other western countries like the US, France, Germany, England, Sweden, Switzerland, etc., the cultural organization and the integration in the local society without losing national identity was bigger. Albanians were integrated in the social life of the country by participating in associations of migrants in cooperation with the citizens and institutions of the host country. Most associations were created in 1998. A primary concern has been to preserve the associations of Albanian identity, against prejudice and racism. Suggested by Barjaba and King about the Greece and Italy, organized in association between Albanians has been weak. primarily because of the marginality of their economic and legal status, but also because of the antipathy of their commitment to community organizations to, that remind the communist past. 6 This makes that their cultural activity was not well documented.

Sharkey', 'Abstract\nCurrent uses of robots in classrooms are reviewed and used to characterise four scenarios: (s1) Robot as Classroom Teacher; (s2) Robot as Companion and Peer; (s3) Robot as Care-eliciting Companion; and (s4) Telepresence Robot Teacher. The main ethical concerns associated with robot teachers are identified as: privacy; attachment, deception, and loss of human contact; and control and accountability. These are discussed in terms of the four identified scenarios. It is argued that classroom robots are likely to impact children‚Äôs‚Äô privacy, especially when they masquerade as their friends and companions, when sensors are used to measure children‚Äôs responses, and when records are kept. Social robots designed to appear as if they understand and care for humans necessarily involve some deception (itself a complex notion), and could increase the risk of reduced human contact. Children could form attachments to robot companions (s2 and s3), or robot teachers (s1) and this could have a deleterious effect on their social development. There are also concerns about the ability, and use of robots to control or make decisions about children‚Äôs behaviour in the classroom. It is concluded that there are good reasons not to welcome fully fledged robot teachers (s1), and that robot companions (s2 and 3) should be given a cautious welcome at best. The limited circumstances in which robots could be used in the classroom to improve the human condition by offering otherwise unavailable educational experiences are discussed.', '2016', 116, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=especially+welcome+thinks+teacher+teachers+pedagogical&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 6),

The question of how Americans think about socioeconomic mobility prospects is drawing growing attention from scholars and policy makers. Our study proposes a survey instrument that connects the empirical literature on patterns of mobility with the literature on the public perceptions of mobility. With large-scale, population-representative data, we show that Americans overestimate the intergenerational persistence in income ranks. That is, they tend to see greater inequality of economic prospects between children from rich and poor families. These results highlight the need for policy and political solutions that seriously engage with Americans‚Äô concerns about the equality of opportunity in the society. Recent research suggests that intergenerational income mobility has remained low and stable in America, but popular discourse routinely assumes that Americans are optimistic about mobility prospects in society. Examining these 2 seemingly contradictory observations requires a careful measurement of the public‚Äôs perceptions of mobility. Unlike most previous work that measures perceptions about mobility outcomes for the overall population or certain subgroups, we propose a survey instrument that emphasizes the variation in perceived mobility prospects for hypothetical children across parent income ranks. Based on this survey instrument, we derive the perceived relationship between the income ranks of parents and children, which can then be compared against the actual rank‚Äìrank relationship reported by empirical work based on tax data. We fielded this instrument in a general population survey experiment (n = 3,077). Our results suggest that Americans overestimate the intergenerational persistence in income ranks.

Although peoples willingness to donate to the poor has gradually increased with economic development, the soil of charity is still not fertile in China. This paper mainly focuses on this problem from the perspective of tax preferences. By comparing the current situation of philanthropy and relevant tax preference policy in China and the United States, this paper analyzes the reasons why peoples charity will is not stimulated, and it proposes improvements on tax policy to promote the development of philanthropy. 1. Comparison of Charitable Donations between China and the United States According to the 2017 China Charitable Contributions Report released by China Charity Alliance on September 21, 2018, China received a total value of 149.986 billion yuan in donations from home and abroad in 2017, accounting for 0.18% of the countrys GDP. Among this, donations from enterprises and individuals totaled 96.334 and 34.917 billion yuan, accounting for 64.23% and 23.28% separately. In the same period, annual U.S. charitable donations amounted to $410 billion, or about RMB 268.1851 billion, which is about 18 times the total amount of China. And the annual U.S. charitable donations account` for 2.1% of GDP, which is 12 times that of China. The gap in the total amount is even more significant reflected in the contribution per person. Per capital donation of China is 107.90 yuan while that of United States was 872 dollars, or RMB 5,978, which is more than 55 times of the data of China. The source composition of U.S. charitable donations is also very different from that of China. In America, donations from individuals account for 70 per cent of the total number. Apart from the differences in the gross national economy and the differences in the per capital income, there is still a significant gap in philanthropy between the two countries. In addition to the important factor that is religious culture, the differences in tax preference policy between the two countries can also be part of the reason. 2. Differences Between the Tax Preferential Systems of China and the United States The existing tax laws for the development of charity in China mainly refer to Individual Income Tax Law of the Peoples Republic of China (Adopted at the Third Meeting of the Fifth National People‚Äôs Congress on September 10th, 1980) and Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Enterprise Income Tax adopted in 2008. For different income objects, specific provisions can be divided into three categories: For charitable organizations, certified charitable organizations may exempt or reduce enterprise income tax when accepting donations from other units, individuals or eligible government subsidies. For individuals and enterprises that donate, donations within certain percentage can be deducted from individual income tax and enterprise income tax. For beneficiaries of charity payments or services, state relief payments for instance, are exempted from individual income tax. Individual income tax on incomes of the disabled, the lonely elderly, family members of martyrs, and income approved by other financial department can also be reduced or exempted. Among the categories above, the second one is the most relevant to donor incentives. The details 2020 International Conference on Big Data Application & Economic Management (ICBDEM 2020) Copyright ¬© (2020) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/icbdem.2020.023 156 are as follows: When calculating the amount of income taxable, an enterprise may deduct its expenses incurred for donation out of public welfare, provided that the portion involved is not more than 12 percent of the total amount of its annual profits. This is updated and revised on February 24, 2017, that the excess of 12% can be carried forward within the next three years. If personal income is donated to education and other social welfare undertakings, social disasters and poverty-stricken areas through social organizations and state organs in China, the portion that does not exceed 30% of taxable income can be deducted. The targets of tax reduction and exemption in different countries are almost the same, but the difference between the standard and the percentage of exemption is obvious enough to produce a disparity in stimulates among the people. In the United States, the tax law provides that a business or organization can deduct no more than 10% of its annual income before paying income tax, and the excess may be carried forward sits in subsequent years for a period of 5 years. Compared with the limit of 12% of profits for Chinese companies, US companies can deduct no more than 10% of income, which is particularly forgiving, and the time limit for carrying forward is longer. What is more, corporate donations are not restricted within currency, securities, equity, trust, etc. can also be used as forms of donation. There is also a detailed reference on how to measure donation. In the case of individual contributions, 50% of eligible contributions can be deducted before tax and the excess can be carried forward over the next 5 years. Both figures also go well beyond those of China, achieving institutional goals to promote charitable donations of residents. And in the United States, if you donate through estate, the deduction ratio can reach 100% [1]. That is why many of Americas billionaires are willing to contribute a large portion of their assets to charity, or even willing to make an all-out donation. With a harsh rate of 50 per cent at most of inheritance tax, the generosity of people will be inspired to the greatest extent [2]. The difference between American corporate and individual charity tax incentives also explains why 70% of the total US charitable donations comes from individuals, because the tax law for individual preferential tax rates is much higher than that of corporations. All data analysis points to the conclusion that the incentive effect of tax policy preferences on willingness of people to donate is obvious and absolute. 3. Defects of Chinas Existing Tax Preferential Policies Through comparison with the policies of the United States, Chinas preferential tax policies have the following problems: The qualifications of charities are difficult to obtain, and tax preferences are difficult to implement [3]. Before a charity organization becomes a formal one, it needs to be approved by relevant government departments. The entire approval process requires the cooperation of departments of civil affairs, taxation, finance and other. However, a standardized reference process has not yet been formed, and the process is laborious with a lack of efficient cooperation among all parties. In actual operation, the Ministry of Civil Affairs often lacks participation. Out of the guarantee of taxation, the tax department usually sets high standards for charities, making it difficult to obtain institutional qualifications for charity organizations. Sometimes the masses really want to participate in charity, but there is no charity institution as a channel. Regulating the procedures for obtaining the qualifications and coordinating inter-departmental work will greatly help public welfare undertakings. Tax relief is based on a single form of contribution China now has a clear tax reduction and exemption policy for donations in the form of currency but there are still a lot of gaps left in the law in other forms of assets such as equity, securities, fixed assets, intellectual property, etc.[4] Tax incentives for equity donations are a typical case. In 2003, the Ministry of Finance issued the Circulars on Strengthening the Financial Administration of the Donations Made by Enterprises, and it clearly states that ‚ÄòThe equity and credit held by the enterprise shall not be used for external donations‚Äô.

Max', 'This Article presents the first empirical study of the domestic jurisdictional competition for trust funds. To allow donors to exploit a loophole in the federal estate tax, since 1986 a host of states have abolished the Rule Against Perpetuities as applied to interests in trust. To allow individuals to shield assets from creditors, since 1997 a handful of states have validated self-settled asset protection trusts. Based on reports to federal banking authorities, we find that, on average, through 2003 a states abolition of the Rule increased its reported trust assets by $6 billion (a 20% increase) and increased its average trust account size by $200,ooo. By contrast, our examination of validating self-settled asset protection trusts yielded indeterminate results. Our perpetuities findings imply that roughly $1oo billion in trust funds have moved to take advantage of the abolition of the Rule. Interestingly, states that levied an income tax on trust funds attracted from out of state experienced no observable increase in trust business after abolishing the Rule. Because this finding implies that abolishing the Rule does not directly increase a states tax revenue, it bears on the study of jurisdictional competition. In spite of the lack of direct tax revenue from attracting trust business, the jurisdictional competition for trust funds is patently real and intense. Our findings also speak to unresolved issues of policy concerning state property law and federal tax law. AUTHORS. Robert H.

Transmitters that provide high spatial resolution have only recently become available for small-bodied animals and show promise for providing new information on habitat use. However, as with any new technology it is important to assess adverse effects on study species. We tested the efficacy of using 1.1-g miniaturized GPS units to document the breeding and post-breeding movements of adult Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) from the federally threatened Atlantic Coast population. We also assessed the potential impact of these miniaturized GPS units on nest survival, chick survival, and apparent adult survival rates. We found that Piping Plover movements to and from nesting areas were related to tidal stage, we documented Piping Plovers to be using previously undocumented foraging areas during the breeding season, and we obtained fine resolution habitat use data for two birds on their wintering areas in the Bahamas. The attachment of a GPS tag had no effect on apparent weekly survival of adults, and we found no differences in daily nest survival and chick survival rates between pairs with GPS tags and controls. GPS tags did not appear to adversely impact Piping Plovers during the breeding season, yet lower return rates of GPS tagged birds than controls might suggest potential negative effects on survival. While GPS tags offer a valuable tool to evaluate habitat use of this threatened species on the breeding grounds, long-term tracking needs further investigation.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=location+locations+rescue+coloradoan+post+posts+gps&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 8),

The objective function of the proposed model minimizes the arrival time at the last designated temporary relief center. The proposed model seeks to locate the temporary relief centers in a way that all affected areas get covered by at least one temporary relief center. Considering the importance of quick action amid a post-disaster environment with characteristics such as uncertain demand for relief supplies, inaccurate information regarding victims, aftershocks, and extensively damaged road networks, in the proposed model, location and level of demand are considered to be dynamic, and relief supplies are assumed to be distributed by aerial transport vehicles. According to NP-Hardness of proposed problem, in this paper an improved hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on scatter search combined with variable neighborhood search is presented. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is tested and compared with an exact method, basic scatter search and genetic algorithm.

A critical time interval was the Carnian Stage (~237‚Äì227¬†Ma), which not only saw the first appearance of dinosaurs in the fossil record but witnessed a large igneous province eruption (Wrangellia LIP) and a sudden climate shift, the Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE). Compelling hypotheses suggest that the Wrangellia eruptions caused the CPE, which in turn set the stage for the origin and initial diversification of dinosaurs. Unfortunately, testing these hypotheses is difficult because most relevant Carnian sedimentary archives possess few if any absolute age constraints, and there are little detailed paleoclimatic data for the CPE outside of the Tethys region. There is little existing evidence for the CPE in Gondwana, even though this region contains by far the best fossil record of early dinosaurs and their close relatives. We present new high-resolution geochronologic and paleoclimatic data from Carnian-aged strata in the Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin of northwest Argentina, which also preserves fossils of the earliest-known dinosaurs. New CA-TIMS U Pb zircon age of 234.47¬†¬±¬†0.44¬†Ma from the lower Los Rastros Formation demonstrates that most of the overlying lacustrine strata within this basin was deposited during or after the CPE, including large dinosauriform footprints. Multiproxy paleoenvironmental data (sedimentology, clay mineralogy, C and O stable isotopes, and fossils) from the same strata are the first detailed paleoclimate data for the CPE in Gondwana, and provide evidence that the CPE interval in western Gondwana was indeed warmer and more humid than before or after.

During fossilization, apatite minerals in vertebrate bones recrystallize from metastable biogenic forms to thermodynamically more stable inorganic apatite minerals while incorporating REEs from their environment. More than ‚àº95% of the REE in fossil bones are diagenetically incorporated post-mortem, and bones in different environments have different and distinct REE signatures, generally viewed to be controlled by sedimentological and taphonomic processes. The REE pattern in fossils is generally stable, and the normalized concentration patterns provide unique ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù or signatures that have been used for various geological and paleontological investigations. The discovery of embryos and their adults at the same site, a previously unrecorded occurrence in the fossil record, allowed us to compare for the first time the relationship between REE concentrations in the same taxon at widely differing ontogenetic stages. Here we compare REE patterns in bones from two distinct sites in Yunnan, China, both preserving embryonic and adult bones of Early Jurassic Sauropodomorpha dinosaurs. These dinosaurs are closely related to each other and close in geological age, and their bones show very similar REE patterns. However, the embryonic bones have significantly lower levels of total REEs when compared to their adult counterparts. We attribute the 10-fold La_REE difference and U concentration 5/1 ratio to the level of ossification of the bones and the dramatically lower concentration of apatites in the embryonic than in the adult bones. We conclude that the ontogenetic stage of fossil materials can have a significant impact on REE concentrations, and discuss the impact of these results on future work.', '2020', 2, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs+dinosaur+breslow+science+early+earth&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

The non-destructive tooth length-based approach to estimating tooth formation time and replacement rate is adopted here. The estimated tooth replacement rate is 76 days, faster than that of Brachiosaurus (83 days) and much lower than typical late diverging lithostrotian titanosaurians (20 days). Thus, this discovery adds an intermediate tooth replacement rate in the evolution of titanosauriform sauropods and supports the idea that evolution of tooth replacement rate is clade-specific. This discovery also provides more information to understand the Ruyang sauropod assemblage, which includes one of the most giant dinosaurs to have walked our Earth (Ruyangosaurus giganteus).', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs+dinosaur+breslow+science+early+earth&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Chasing after dinosaurs is really a quest to fill in part of our own backstory [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (Switek 2014). Such popularity creates specific expectations in the public, who wants to receive reliable as well as enjoyable representations of their favorite prehistoric creatures. Children in particular are enthusiastic about dinosaurs as it is demonstrated by merchandise of all sorts, dedicated exhibitions, narrative and syllabus books, movies, websites, and TV shows. The present study investigates the animated series Dinosaur Train , chosen since it contains animated episodes and live action segments in which a real paleontologist gives scientific facts about the dinosaurs seen in each episode. Sample episodes are analysed verbally and visually: the verbal features are examined to identify the strategies of knowledge dissemination (KD) present in the series, while visual patterns were investigated through a multimodal analysis (Kress, van Leeuwen 2006; Baldry, Thibault 2006). In particular, the study considers the way(s) in which the series presents dinosaurs that are already well-known and those that are more unfamiliar. Results show that the popularity of the series is due to the structure of the episodes, composed of several phases, which make the series dynamic, thus suitable to young children‚Äôs attention span, as well as to an accessible language that makes the stories interesting, also thanks to the representation of everyday situations lived by the dinosaurs that are already familiar to the viewers.', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs+dinosaur+breslow+science+early+earth&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

Chen, S. Zhang, Xiaobo Li, L. K√≥tai, R. Reisz', 'There is broad consensus that many bones of extinct vertebrates contain Rare Earth Elements (REE) and other trace minerals that have been incorporated and enriched into the fossil during diagenesis. During fossilization, apatite minerals in vertebrate bones recrystallize from metastable biogenic forms to thermodynamically more stable inorganic apatite minerals while incorporating REEs from their environment. More than ‚àº95% of the REE in fossil bones are diagenetically incorporated post-mortem, and bones in different environments have different and distinct REE signatures, generally viewed to be controlled by sedimentological and taphonomic processes. The REE pattern in fossils is generally stable, and the normalized concentration patterns provide unique ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù or signatures that have been used for various geological and paleontological investigations. The discovery of embryos and their adults at the same site, a previously unrecorded occurrence in the fossil record, allowed us to compare for the first time the relationship between REE concentrations in the same taxon at widely differing ontogenetic stages. Here we compare REE patterns in bones from two distinct sites in Yunnan, China, both preserving embryonic and adult bones of Early Jurassic Sauropodomorpha dinosaurs. These dinosaurs are closely related to each other and close in geological age, and their bones show very similar REE patterns. However, the embryonic bones have significantly lower levels of total REEs when compared to their adult counterparts. We attribute the 10-fold La_REE difference and U concentration 5/1 ratio to the level of ossification of the bones and the dramatically lower concentration of apatites in the embryonic than in the adult bones. We conclude that the ontogenetic stage of fossil materials can have a significant impact on REE concentrations, and discuss the impact of these results on future work.', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=dinosaurs+dinosaur+breslow+science+early+earth&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 10),

The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group and consultants with expertise in ethics and health equity considered external expert committee reports and published literature and deliberated the ethical issues associated with COVID-19 vaccine allocation decisions. The purpose of this report is to describe the four ethical principles that will assist ACIP in formulating recommendations for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccine while supply is limited, in addition to scientific data and implementation feasibility: 1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; 2) promote justice; 3) mitigate health inequities; and 4) promote transparency.

After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ‚â•12 years and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ‚â•18 years (1-3). Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. ACIP has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. During the most recent meeting in July 2021, ACIP determined that, overall, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ‚â•18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. ACIP continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all persons aged ‚â•12 years. CDC and FDA continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to ACIP for consideration.

A team led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) proposed a revolutionary lander that uses rotors to land in Titan‚Äôs thick atmosphere and low gravity and can repeatedly transit to new sites, multiplying the mission‚Äôs science value from its capable instrument payload. Titan is an ‚Äúocean world‚Äù that is rich in both carbon and nitrogen.4,5 See Table 1 for data on Titan‚Äôs environment. FORMULATION OF THE DRAGONFLY CONCEPT The NASA community announcement in January 2016 identifying Titan as a possible target for the fourth New Frontiers mission opened new possibilities in Titan exploration (Box 1). Although the exploration of Titan‚Äôs seas had previously been considered, notably by the APL-led Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) Discovery concept,6,7 the timing mandated by the announcement of opportunity precluded such a mission. Specifically, with launch specified prior to the end of 2025, Titan arrival would be in the mid-2030s, during northern winter. This means the seas, near Titan‚Äôs north pole, are in darkness and direct-to-Earth (DTE) communication is impossible.8 Even with the higher budget threshold of New Frontiers 4 ($850 million plus launch and operations costs) compared with Discovery (~$450 million INTRODUCTION Saturn‚Äôs moon Titan is in many ways the most Earthlike body in the solar system.1‚Äì3 This strange world is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick nitrogen atmosphere laden with organic smog, which partly hides its surface from view. Since cold Titan is far from the Sun, on Titan methane plays the active role that water plays on Earth, serving as a condensable greenhouse gas, forming clouds and rain, and pooling on the surface as lakes and seas. Titan‚Äôs carbon-rich surface is shaped not only by impact craters and by winds that sculpt drifts of aromatic organics into long linear dunes but also by methane rivers and possible eruptions of liquid water (‚Äúcryovolcanism‚Äù). While living things are ~70% water, and finding water has been a convenient initial focus for astrobiological investigations in the solar system, the chemical processes that conspire to lead to life rely on functions exerted by compounds of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen, with traces of sulfur and phosphorus (CHNOPS). In contrast to Europa (abundant in water, and perhaps sulfur), Dragonfly: A Rotorcraft Lander Concept for Scientific Exploration at Titan Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Volume 34, Number 3 (2018), www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest 375 plus radioisotope power source and launch costs), it would be challenging indeed to provide a relay spacecraft and a sea probe. A lander with DTE communication would be possible at lower latitudes, however. The only detailed study of such a mission (see Box 2) was the 2007 Titan Explorer NASA Flagship Mission Study,9,10 led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). This study advocated the science that could be obtained from three platforms, an orbiter, a hot-air (Montgolfi√®re) balloon, and a lander. The lander (designed before Titan‚Äôs seas had been discovered) was intended to be delivered to Titan‚Äôs Belet sand sea, a large‚Äîand thus easily targeted‚Äî dune field expected to be free of rock and gully hazards. After the lander‚Äôs parachute descent and landing on Pathfinder-like airbags (wherein if it landed on top of a dune, it would just roll down to the bottom), petals would unfold and science would begin, with cameras, a chemical analysis suite, a seismometer, and a meteorology package. Much of the science definition in the Titan Explorer Study was useful in formulating the Dragonfly proposal. A scientific limitation of a single lander, however, is that it explores only a single location. This limitation can be mitigated slightly at ‚Äúgrab-bag‚Äù landing sites where geological processes have gathered samples from a range of areas (in Mars Pathfinder‚Äôs case, a flood deposit of rocks; dune sands may similarly have material from a range of source locations). However, a lander with some kind of mobility, or augmented by some mobile element (e.g., a ‚Äúfetch‚Äù rover), would help address the challenge of acquiring samples from sites more interesting than the landing point, a site that would be most likely selected for safety rather than for scientific interest. The concept of a rotorcraft lander on Titan tricklecharging a battery for brief atmospheric flights by using the power from a radioisotope power source had been proposed some 17 years ago.11,12 At that time, the vehicle was imagined to be a helicopter, a vehicle that is used on Earth for near-guaranteed access to a wide range of terrain, for personnel delivery, and for search and rescue. However, helicopters are mechanically complex (one', '2018', 81, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

Butler, Wesley G. Page', 'Abstract One of the critical factors affecting travel rates while hiking, jogging, or running along a trail is the slope of the underlying terrain. Models for predicting this effect have been used in a wide variety of scientific and applied contexts, including recreation planning, search and rescue, wildland firefighter safety, social network analysis, and recreating historical human movement patterns. Despite their wide use, these models are based on datasets with very small sample sizes that were collected without using instantaneous measures of travel rate and assume symmetrical effects about the slope of maximum travel rate. These models also typically resulted in a single mathematical function, ignoring the significant variability that can occur between a fast and a slow individual, or between walking and running travel rates. In this study we modeled travel rates using a database of GPS tracks from 29,928 individuals representing 421,247 individual hikes, jogs, and runs on trails in and around Salt Lake City, Utah for an entire year between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. Three widely-used probability distribution functions (Laplace, Gauss, and Lorentz) were used to predict travel rates based on terrain slope along segments of trails with uniform slopes. To account for the variability in travel rates between fast and slow movement, a series of travel rate models were generated to predict travel rate percentiles, ranging from the 1st to the 99th, thus providing a flexible basis for predicting travel rates as a function of slope. The large number of samples allowed us to introduce a novel term that accounts for asymmetry in travel rates on uphill and downhill slopes. All three functions performed well, with Lorentz percentile models averaging an R2 of 0.958 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.078‚ÄØm/s, Laplace with R2 of 0.953 and MAE of 0.088‚ÄØm/s, and Gauss with R2 of 0.949 and MAE of 0.090‚ÄØm/s. All three functions performed notably better at estimating lower travel rate percentiles (e.g. 5th: R2Lorentz‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.941; R2Laplace‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.940; R2Gauss‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.934) as compared to higher (e.g. 95th: R2Lorentz‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.914; R2Laplace‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.913; R2Gauss‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.908), indicating greater consistency in walking rates than the fastest running rates. Lorentz outperformed the other functions for the widest range of percentiles (5th, 30th-90th), and thus is recommended for use as a flexible travel rate prediction function. However, Laplace tended to produce the best results at moderately-low travel rate percentiles (10th-25th), suggesting a combination of the two models could produce the highest accuracies. The results of this research provide a sound basis for future studies aiming to estimate travel rates while hiking or running along slopes.', '2019', 11, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

In 2014- 2016, she conducted qualitative research and analysis as part of a nationwide project GENTOUR II ( www.genderintourism.com ) on the role of gender in tourism labour, investigating the role of gender equality in boosting innovative forms of economic growth in tourism and focusing on aspects of management, recruitment, the pay gap, economic innovation, internationalisation and networking in Portugal. In addition, working in a research group rated as ‚ÄòExcellent‚Äô by the national funding agency (FCT), Fiona actively collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of researchers to promote sustainable regional development through tourism. She focused on the cultural dimensions of tourism, intangible heritage and festivals and social inclusion through urban tourism. Fiona‚Äôs future research will focus on creating new conceptualizations of creative tourism in rural areas and analyzing the creative tourism offer created within the CREATOUR network from a variety of angles, including a social embeddedness perspective. CREATOUR ( www.creatour.pt ) is a three-year project (2016-2019) and an incubator/demonstration and multidisciplinary research initiative that aims to connect the cultural/creative and tourism sectors through the development of an integrated research and application approach to catalyzing creative tourism in small cities and rural areas throughout Portugal. During the project, five research centres are working with a range of stakeholders located in small cities across Portugal in the Norte, Centro, Alentejo and Algarve regions, to create a creative tourism network. Fiona is helping to coordinate the research centres, write reports, articles and book chapters, participate and present at regional IdeaLabs (researcher-participant creative knowledge production and networking sessions), organise scientific events and undertake pilot site-visits. Fiona has published in various peer-reviewed journals and books on aspects of creative and cultural tourism, gender in tourism labour, qualitative methodologies, handicrafts, entrepreneurship, rural tourism, ecotourism, and feminist economics.

Schechtman, M. Buist, Benjamin H Cloyd, K. Tremper, D. Healy', 'November 15, 2019 ‚Ä¢ Volume 13 ‚Ä¢ Number 10 cases-anesthesia-analgesia.org 405 In Response We would like to thank Chrimes et al for their interest and discussion of our recent publication describing our institutional approach to the management of cannot intubate and cannot oxygenate (CICO) events.1 We agree that the original article underattributed the foundational and existing work of Heard et al2 from the Royal Perth Hospital in Perth, Western Australia. An erratum providing additional textual attribution was published in the August A & A Practice issue and added to the original article.1,3 The erratum emphasizes that the use of the term ‚Äúunique‚Äù applied solely to our local implementation of existing techniques. We also added an additional reference to existing work, missed during the compilation of the original article.2 We are grateful for the opportunity to provide this additional recognition and thank Heard and colleagues for their leadership in airway management and patient safety. In clarification, the original publication described existing techniques (cannula rescue oxygenation and the scalpel bougie technique) modified to the needs of a North American tertiary referral health care system, recognizing existing work and published descriptions.1,2,4 The stepwise use of these existing techniques was referenced and attributed to Heard et al2 using standard citations. However, we agree with our colleagues‚Äô letters and feel that the existing work deserves additional textual attribution given the significant and defining contributions by Heard et al2 to equipment recommendation and the overall approach to emergency front of neck access (eFONA) during CICO events. Yet, while respecting, referencing, and attributing the established techniques and stepwise approach to Heard et al,2 fundamental distinctions remain between the existing approaches2 and our application through the OxyTain algorithm and its required equipment.1 The differences can be attributed to the modifications required to operationalize the previously described techniques in a high-volume North American tertiary referral medical center. First, given the ubiquity of 24-hour availability of otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and trauma surgery teams in large tertiary referral health systems, the OxyTain algorithm describes a significant role for the otolaryngology (or equivalent) service during CICO events. Douglas et al ask if ‚Äúthere is any guidance beyond waiting for an Ear-NoseThroat (ENT) surgeon?‚Äù We emphasize the importance of continued attempts at oxygenation in the event of 4 failed eFONA attempts (2 attempts at cannula cricothyroidotomy and 2 with the scalpel bougie approach). Yet, within our institutional practice, the otolaryngology service response is activated simultaneously with other members of the airway emergency response team (identical first-line pager response). Consequently, the otolaryngology service is able to consistently respond to airway emergencies within the time required for an anesthesia provider to complete 4 eFONA attempts. Second, the OxyTain algorithm utilizes a color-coded stepwise approach, pairing color-coded equipment bags with visual aids to help instruct the responders and optimize human performance during a stressful event. The color-coded stepwise approach is supported through standardized equipment and clinical training using manikin, porcine tracheal, and 3-dimensional printed tracheal models. Importantly, our article describes standardized equipment in a designated and secured ‚Äúemergency airway‚Äù drawer within the existing storage of our anesthesia machines. This enables standardization, familiarity, and assurance of accessible equipment for CICO management at all anesthetizing locations (>100) and in a system with over 500 clinical anesthesia providers (anesthesia faculty, postgraduate anesthesia physician trainees, and certified registered nurse anesthetists). While Gordon et al describe similarities to the established work in their letters, they also draw attention to the differences that exist between the current and existing work. Equipment in support of the OxyTain approach utilizes the 13-gauge Ravussin jet-ventilation catheter (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz am Neckar, Germany) in contrast to the 14-gauge BD Insyte cannula (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) recommended by Heard et al.2 The 13-gauge Ravussin jet-ventilation catheter is specifically designed and supplied for eFONA. Our institutional decision to use the Ravussin jet-ventilation catheter (in variance to Heard et al2 existing guidance) sought to align our adult eFONA equipment with the existing institutional standard for eFONA used in our pediatric hospital (14and 16-gauge Ravussin jet-ventilation catheters). Respecting the contribution from our pediatric colleagues allowed us to standardize our approach and equipment across all of our patient care locations. Other advantages to the Ravussin jetventilation catheters include a tie to secure them in place, a steel needle, and lateral holes in the catheter for insertion and to prevent the catheter from resting against the tracheal wall during jet oxygenation. Also, the catheter has a 15-mm connector for connection to a breathing circuit.5 Finally, our approach removes the previously described requirement to perform a neck incision and finger palpation after an initially failed cannula rescue technique. We feel this step to be unnecessary, adding complexity and potentially delaying the timely performance of the scalpel bougie technique, which is considered standard as a sole technique in published approaches to airway rescue.6 DOI: 10.1213/XAA.0000000000001112 The OxyTain Algorithm: An Adaptation of Existing Emergency Front of Neck Access Approaches Within a North American Tertiary Referral Health Care System LETTERS TO THE EDITOR', '2019', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

Lim', 'This paper is intended to evaluate the sample collection process with respect to sample characterization and decision making. In some cases, it may be sufficient to know whether a given outcrop or hand sample is the same as or different from previous sampling localities or samples. In other cases, it may be important to have more in-depth characterization of the sample, such as basic composition, mineralogy, and petrology, in order to effectively identify the best sample. Contextual field observations, in situ/handheld analysis, and backroom evaluation may all play a role in understanding field lithologies and their importance for return. For example, whether a rock is a breccia or a clast-laden impact melt may be difficult based on a single sample, but becomes clear as exploration of a field site puts it into context. The FINESSE (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Science and Exploration) team is a new activity focused on a science and exploration field based research program aimed at generating strategic knowledge in preparation for the human and robotic exploration of the Moon, near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and Phobos and Deimos. We used the FINESSE field excursion to the West Clearwater Lake Impact structure (WCIS) as an opportunity to test factors related to sampling decisions. In contract to other technology-driven NASA analog studies, The FINESSE WCIS activity is science-focused, and moreover, is sampling-focused, with the explicit intent to return the best samples for geochronology studies in the laboratory. This specific objective effectively reduces the number of variables in the goals of the field test and enables a more controlled investigation of the role of the crewmember in selecting samples. We formulated one hypothesis to test: that providing details regarding the analytical fate of the samples (e.g. geochronology, XRF/XRD, etc.) to the crew prior to their traverse will result in samples that are more likely to meet specific analytical objectives than samples collected in the absence of this premission information. We conducted three tests of this hypothesis. Our investigation was designed to document processes, tools and procedures for crew sampling of planetary targets. This is not meant to be a blind, controlled test of crew efficacy, but rather an effort to recognize the relevant variables that enter into sampling protocol and to develop recommendations for crew and backroom training in future endeavors. Methods: One of the primary FINESSE field deployment objectives was to collect impact melt rocks and impact melt-bearing breccias from a number of locations around the WCIS structure to enable high precision geochronology of the crater to be performed [1]. We conducted three tests at WCIS after two full days of team participation in field site activities, including using remote sensing data and geologic maps, hiking overland to become familiar with the terrain, and examining previously-collected samples from other islands. In addition, the team members shared their projects and techniques with the entire team. We chose our \"crew members\" as volunteers from the team, all of whom had had moderate training in geologic fieldwork and became familiar with the general field setting. The first two tests were short, focused tests of our hypothesis. Test A was to obtain hydrothermal vugs; Test B was to obtain impact melt and intrusive rock as well as the contact between the two to check for contact metamorphism and age differences. In both cases, the test director had prior knowledge of the site geology and had developed a study-specific objective for sampling prior to deployment. Prior to the field deployment, the crewmember was briefed on the sampling objective and the laboratory techniques that would be used on the samples. At the field sites (Fig. 2), the crewmember was given 30 minutes to survey a small section of outcrop (10-15 m) and acquire a suite of three samples. The crewmember talked through his process and the test director kept track of the timeline in verbal cues to the crewmember. At the conclusion, the team member conducting the scientific study appraised the samples and train of thought. Test C was a 90-minute EVA simulation using two crewmembers working out of line-of-sight in communication with a science backroom. The science objectives were determined by the science backroom team in advance using a Gigapan image of the outcrop (Fig. 1). The science team formulated hypotheses for the outcrop units and created sampling objectives for impact-melt lithologies; the science team turned these into a science plan, which they communicated to the crew in camp prior to crew deployment. As part of the science plan, the science team also discussed their sample needs in depth with the crewmembers, including laboratory methods, objectives, and samples sizes needed. During the deployment, the two crewmembers relayed real-time information to the science backroom by radio with no time delay. Both the crew and science team re-evaluated their hypotheses and science plans in real-time. Discussion: Upon evaluation, we found that the focused tests (Tests A and B) were successful in meeting their scientific objectives. The crewmember used their knowledge of how the samples were to be used in further study (technique, sample size, and scientific need) to focus on the sampling task. The crewmember was comfortable spending minimal time describing and mapping the outcrop. The crewmember used all available time to get a good sample. The larger test was unsuccessful in meeting the sampling objectives. When the crewmembers began describing the lithologies, it was quickly apparent that the lithologies were not as the backroom expected and had communicated to the crew. When the outcrop wasnt as expected, the crew members instinctively switched to field characterization mode, taking significant time to characterize and map the outcrop. One crew member admitted that he \"kind of lost track\" of the sampling strategy as he focused on the basic outcrop characterization. This is the logical first step in a field geology campaign, that a significant amount of time must be spent by the crew and backroom to understand the outcrop and its significance. Basic field characterization of an outcrop is a focused activity that takes significant time and training [2, 3]. Sampling of representational lithologies can be added to this activity for little cost [4]. However, we have shown that identification of unusual or specific samples for laboratory study also takes significant time and knowledge. We suggest that sampling of this type be considered a separate activity from field characterization, and that crewmembers be trained in sampling needs for different kinds of studies (representative lithologies vs. specialized samples) to acquire a mindset for sampling similar to field mapping. Sampling activities should be given a significant amount of specifically allocated time in scheduling EVA activities; and in the better case, that sampling be done as a second activity to a previously studied outcrop where both crew and backroom are comfortable with its context and characteristics. Our hypothesis posited that crewmember knowledge of how the samples would be used upon return would aid them in choosing relevant samples. Our testing bore this hypothesis out to some extent. We therefore recommend that crewmember training should include exposure to the laboratory techniques and analyses that will be used on the samples to foster this knowledge. There is also the potential for increasing crewmember contextual knowledge real-time in the field through the introduction of in situ geochemical technologies such as field portable XRF. The presence of field portable geochemical technology could enable the astronauts to interrogate the samples for K abundance real-time, ensuring they could collect valuable and dateable samples [5].

Considering interdisciplinarity as an important strategy for the organization of work in the care of CAPS users, the dimension of perceptions in the context of mental health team practices becomes relevant. Objectives: General: to understand the mental health professionals perception about deinstitutionalization and their lived experiences in daily care practices in the context of the CAPS. The specific objectives are: to describe the perception of mental health professionals about the deinstitutionalization of the subject, to elucidate the experiences of the professionals in the daily practices of attending to the users in the CAPS and to discuss the interdisciplinary construction of the Unique Therapeutic Project, especially in relation to the reception, Bond, completeness and resolution. Methodology: This is an exploratory-descriptive field research, with a qualitative approach. The data will be collected using phenomenological interviews with 12 professionals from the multiprofessional team of two CAPS in the Lakes Region. In order to select them, those that act directly with the users, with at least one year of service in this service and, excluding those who are on vacation or leave, or those who for some reason may or not wish to participate.

Classed as a category 4 hurricane (with wind speeds of 130 to 156 miles per hour [mph]) as it hit the southeastern Texas coast on August 25, the storm brought with it as much as 50 inches of rain in some locations. Working on the ground is the Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team (VET), which is called on by the state and responds to disasters such as Harvey. Made up of vets, vet technicians, vet students and administrative support staff, the team is currently helping to deal with any animal issues that arise. Angela Clendenin, a public information officer for the VET, said the team had never seen anything like Harvey before. ‚ÄòThe thing that‚Äôs really unique about this is you typically have the initial impact and then it moves on. Hurricanes typically come in from the coast, they hit the coast and they move inland and upwards and dissipate. Harvey decided to hang out on the coast for a little while, and moved up along the coast so that the band of significant rainfall was all going inland, and dumping up to 20 inches of rain into swollen rivers and lakes. The coastal communities had this big storm surge coming in, so it‚Äôs flooding from both sides. ‚ÄòThis is the first time we‚Äôve ever seen anything of this magnitude along the coast and with the torrential rain in one place.‚Äô Because the storm stayed on the coast for so long, it took the team longer than usual to respond. ‚ÄòSearch and rescue teams go in after the disaster happens ‚Äì it needs to be safe for them to go in,‚Äô Clendenin explained. ‚ÄòThey are starting a little bit later than they usually would have.‚Äô The VET‚Äôs work is twofold. The team acts as first responders, providing assistance for animals located by search and rescue teams. From the initial triage, the team assesses the animals found and treats what it can. Animals that cannot be treated on the ground are taken to a nearby veterinary practice ‚Äì Clendenin explained that it was important to treat the animals near the site of the disaster so they could be reunited with their owners as easily as possible. The second line of work is with the search and rescue dogs used by the rescue teams. These dogs go into dangerous environments and places that are inaccessible to people. To keep them healthy, the VET assesses the dogs before, during and after their missions. ‚ÄòWhen you have the correct veterinary support for these animals, you can almost double the length of time they are able to be in the field and that means more lives saved,‚Äô Clendenin explained. Also helping following Hurricane Harvey is the Humane Society for the United States (HSUS). It was called in to take animals to safety before the hurricane hit and is now working to help stranded animals. Dickie Vest, a vet at the Texas-based Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch and medical director for the HSUS animal care centres, is involved in the disaster recovery effort. Speaking of the kind of cases he has seen, he said that HSUS had conducted an aerial survey of the Texas gulf coast and had identified ‚Äòthousands of cattle‚Äô that were isolated or displaced by the flood waters. The first priority was to provide fresh water and forage. But more worrying, he said, was stress in these animals. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre surrounded by water. They‚Äôre ankle to knee, even chest deep in water with no dry place to go . . . the stress of being surrounded by water, the energy expenditure, and both internal and external parasites will increase exponentially as the days go on. ‚ÄòWhen these cows go under stress for any amount of time we know that their immune system is affected for 45 to 60 days, maybe even more. This type of situation makes conditions, especially infectious disease conditions such as pneumonia, a high likelihood in these cattle . . . we are going to see a fairly high incidence of pneumonia, and a lot of that pneumonia will be fatal. For cases that are not fatal and are treatable, it will affect these cattle for some time.‚Äô He described Hurricane Harvey as a real challenge. ‚ÄòIt has been a challenge and it has resulted in a lot of cattle still out there isolated, displaced or both.‚Äô Going forward, Vest said solutions needed to be put in place in the area to accurately identify ranchers, their boundaries, the number of animals and how to respond to ‚Äòget the right help, in the right place, at the right time‚Äô. With Hurricane Irma on its way, these lessons needed to be learnt, and fast, he said.', '2017', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

This phenomenon is all the most relevant to investigate in France that there is a growing enthusiasm for outdoor sports and recreation. This paper focuses on the social-demographic and sporting profiles of accident victims. Our intent is to better understand who is specifically at risk, while practicing mountain recreation, in the French mountains. Such identification doubtlessly constitutes an important asset in order to enhance prevention. Three critical activities are notably tackled, among some others: hiking, a widespread activity that exposes many practitioners to hazardous settings; mountaineering and ski touring, supposedly entailing the most severe injuries. In order to align the information collected, then provide estimations based on the reasoned crossing of these secondary data, we consulted and summarised all the databases that we knew of on the French territory: rescue team intervention reports, aggregated statistics from the sports ministry, sporting federation accident declarations, avalanche experts statistics, mountain guides union accident/incident reports, healthcare facilities admissions, etc. Only the sources considered to be the most reliable and representative were used, owing to the number of cases processed, the exhaustive nature of data collection, or the level of information detail available. Our method also included consultation of all the parties playing an active role in prevention, training and mountain rescue, thus ensuring a participative, co-constructive approach to the study with the people that have the best knowledge of victims‚Äô profiles. Around fifty such parties were interviewed on the methods implemented, the benefits and limits of current data, and the main expectations in terms of accidentology progress, thus further enhancing the credibility of the study proposed in this paper. Our results show that the parent population profiles (in terms of age, gender, place of residence, etc.), weighted by the level of exposure (frequency of participation, level of engagement, etc.) appears to have an impact on the accident victim profiles. There is certainly a very marked gender bias and a serious age impact to be taken into account, as well as the influence of the level of experience, which counter certain preconceived ideas and which, at the very least, go against instinct. However, aside from a probable over-exposure of experienced or expert participants, much remains to be explained concerning the accident mechanisms and circumstances involved. At this stage, we regret the analytic deficiencies induced by a lack of knowledge concerning the parent populations in many cases, which makes interpretation difficult.', '2017', 7, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

Shike', 'Objective As members of CNEDERT, we were trusted to take the mission of medical rescue in April of this year in Yushu area of Qinghai province. As soon as we heard of the news of earthquake with shock of 7.1 on Richter scale happened on 14th April 2010, our team of 32 members from the General Hospital of Armed Police Force rapidly rushed to get there at 19 oclock on 14th April. It is a cold plateau with 4000 meters in average above sea level. Of course, they would face many difficult problems and some of them could not be figured out in advance. It was really a new and big challenge. First of all, we had to bear the very low barometric pressure,threatening lives of team members. In order to fulfill the mission of medical rescue, and to prevent the acute mountain sickness (AMS) ,we monitored the physiological changes of every member. Method A total of 32 members aged from 27 - 42 years old with average age of (33.26 + 12.54) years, 6 male and 6 female, gathered at Peking, 50 meters above sea level, 6 hours ahead of getting to Yushu and received physical examination with measurements of SaO2, HR, Hb and breath holding test. The team worked in Yushu area for 13 days and returned back to Peking on 27th April at 13 oclock. The measurements of SaO2, HR and He were kept on from 14th April to 4th May, 21 days in total. The occurrence of AMS was surveyed by questionnaire from 18 to 48 hours after arrival,and the AMSA was diagnosed and scored according to the Lake Louise consensus on the definition and quantification of altitude illness. When the score was equal or above 3, it was considered to be AMS. Our work activities included searching the victims under the collapsed building, carrying out treatment and operation as soon as possible in the mobile hospital, doing medical round visiting, public health and disease prevention, work of joint rescue of multiple professions and psychological counseling. Results Of them 26 (81.25%) members suffered from AMS of various severities and few of them had pulmonary edema and hematuria, and those with SaO2 below 60% were sent down to the plain of low level above sea. The average level of SaO2 at Peking was ( 98.21 + 2.63) %, and it suddenly dropped to (66.31 ¬± 4.24)% on the first day of entering Yushu area, and from the 2nd day on, it gradually increased to (84.80 ¬± 4.20)% on the 13th day of stay in Yushu. On the 14th day, we returned back to Peking, the average SaO2 gradually went up from ( 85.57 + 2.73) % to (85.70 + 3.11 ) % on the 15th day,(87.93¬±2.63)% on the 17th day, (92.21 ¬±3.62)% on the 18th day, and (98.2333 ¬± 1.78)% On the 21st day (5th May ). At plain the average HR was (78 ¬± 11 ) beats/min, and it went up abruptly to ( 121 ¬± 18) beats/min on the first day of arrival to Yushu, and from the 2nd day on, it slowly lowered down to (99¬± 12) beats/min at the end day of stay in Yushu area. When we got back to Peking, the average HR gradually normalized from (91¬± 18) beats/min to (77 + 16) beats on the 5th May. The average Hb in Peking was ( 118 ¬± 32) g/L, and it gradually increased to ( 137 ¬± 18) g/L on the 5th day and to ( 161 ¬± 27) g/L on the 11th day after arrival, and it gradually dropped to (127:¬± 13) g/L on the 17th day and to (120¬± 13) g/L on the 21st day. Various measures were taken to treat and prevent the AMS with Chinese herbal medicines such as hongjingtian (Rholiola sacra [Prain ex Hamet] Fu), droplet-sized pill of danshen (salva miltiorrhiza Bge), slice of xiyangshen (Panax quinquefolium L)for lozenge which had some effect of minimizing the symptoms of AMS, and with easily digestible diet catered for in less amount of food in each meal and more meals every day, and diet was composed of mainly carbohydrate and vitamins. Large amount of fluid was required at least 4000 - 6000 mL daily guided by the number of urination at least once or twice a day. For the severe case with shortness of breath and sense of oppression over chest, the oxygen inhalation and intravenous glucose saline with small dose of hydrocortisone were given. Conclusions There were great changes in SaO2, HR and Hb of individuals rushed into high altitude area from plain of low level above sea in a short length of time. But those individuals had the capability of adaptation to ameliorate bit by bit those changes day by day until 13 days of stay, the end of stay at high altitude. On that day, the levels of SaO2, HR and He were still far away from normal. And those changes took 6 days to resume the original levels after the members retumed to the plain. Of them, 81.25% (26/32) members suffered from AMS of various severities. Various measures taken to treat and prevent the AMS are very important. In addition, working at high altitude area, the medical equipment and facilities should be miniaturized for easy portability on the rugged and narrow footpath in order to preserve the energy of medical members. \n \nKey words: \nChina International Search and Rescue Team;¬† Earthquake relief;¬† Altitude sickness;¬†Oxygen saturation;¬† Heart rate;¬† Hemoglobin;¬† Hypoxia', '2010', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=teams+team+hiker+hikers+rescuers+number+lakes+lake&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 13),

The author writes, ‚ÄúFight the Power argues that race was the major reason for police brutality and the false racialized narratives were a major impediment to struggles for change. Police officers, along with many in the general society, equated blackness with criminality and attempted to control black people through brutal force‚Äù (6). Chapter by chapter, Taylor describes countless individuals and groups who attempted to redefine their own image and gain political power through protests and greater citizen input regarding how the police operated in their communities, specifically demanding a greater role in review boards and measures to improve police-community relations. Taylor champions the Nation of Islam as a group that defied the police-African American power dynamic. Contrary to its public persona, the group has often achieved political and social power through diplomacy and agency, rather than through violence. Taylor describes how, time and time again, Malcolm X‚Äôs by-any-means tactics included pragmatic relationships with law enforcement, and subpoenas in lieu of armed conflict. The Nation of Islam realized that power did not always come from the barrel of a gun, but could also be achieved through discourse, demonstrations, and agency. The remainder of the work chronicles how social protests such as strikes, boycotts, and other media campaigns have been an effective way to achieve economic power. In the current era, chastisement and shame via social media are only the start and will not work without tangible consequences. Under the subheading ‚ÄúCommunity Control,‚Äù the Movement for Black Lives calls for ‚Äúdirect democratic community control‚Äù over law enforcement agencies to ensure that the communities ‚Äúmost harmed by destructive policing have the power to hire and fire officers and subpoena relevant agency information‚Äù (252). Another demand of many of the activists is a more diverse police force that resembles its specific community, and there have been gains in that area as the New York Police Department has seen an increase in non-white officers. Yet police brutality continues, and many are quick to point out that, in some cases, the accused officers are African American or Hispanic. This argument can be contested with the idea of blue versus black, even without a monolithic white officer class. However, the larger discussion of this work goes well beyond physical brutality and into the institutional abuse of power. The author demonstrates how abuse takes many forms beyond deadly violence. Although shootings, physical altercations, and chokeholds rightfully grab the lion‚Äôs share of the media attention, more subtle and growing inequities in power are the true culprit, and this publication provides further analysis in those areas. The content of the work also examines less-covered violations such as false arrests and imprisonment, unreasonable search, harassment, intimidation, and verbal abuse. As the anti-police groups argue, abuse of power is police brutality. Furthermore, Taylor‚Äôs overarching conclusions assert that knowing of cases in which other races are also targeted by abuse does not diminish the story. If anything, such cases make the problem larger, as it should be every citizen‚Äôs concern. Taylor concludes, ‚ÄúWhites, Asians, women and others have suffered police assaults and misconduct. Ending police brutality is in the interest of everyone, not just those who have historically been victims‚Äù (252).', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=kelley+omar+police+news+political+politics&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 14),

Findings illustrate how news reports (1) use the repeated category formulation police shooting of a Black man to imply police are culpable for engaging in racist shootings, (2) upgrade culpability of police officers through adding to racial categorization of victims in ways that foreground victims moral character (e.g., unarmed Black man), and (3) highlight racism as an explanation for shootings and culpability of police through using racial categorizations for police officers. Overall, news media reports use racial categories as a resource to construct racism as an explanation for police shootings and to construct police officers and policing institutions as culpable for these shootings.

Yet, most investigations have neglected to examine contemporary media diets, such as online consumption and engagement, and attitudes toward the police. Using a sample of mostly young adults, the current study contributes to the media effects literature by examining the relationships between online (Internet and social media) consumption and engagement and attitudes toward police legitimacy. Results indicate that consuming negative police stories on the Internet is associated with perceiving the police as less legitimate.

McKean, J. Margaret', 'ABSTRACT\n\nCharacterisation in Ward‚Äôs opera The Crucible: Melodic interpretation of Salem‚Äôs witches and their accusers via historical accounts and Miller‚Äôs play\n\nThis thesis is a consideration of the transition of the characters of Robert Ward‚Äôs opera The Crucible from history through to Arthur Miller‚Äôs play of the same name, and finally to the linear elements of the opera: the libretto and the vocal melodies.\n\nArthur Miller‚Äôs The Crucible (1953) is widely known as a play that explores the complex characters that were involved in the real life events that took place in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 as the town‚Äôs young girls accused innocent townspeople of witchcraft. The thesis discusses the background to Miller‚Äôs decision to write The Crucible; his concern about the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC); audiences‚Äô initial adverse reaction to the obvious parallels Miller was drawing; and ultimately Miller‚Äôs own calling to HUAC.\n\nBy 1961 when Robert Ward, composer, and Bernard Stambler, librettist, collaborated on their Pulitzer Prize winning opera, The Crucible, the American public had revolted against McCarthyism and HUAC; and Miller had had great success with an off-Broadway revival of his play. The Crucible was a now familiar story for Americans, and Ward and Stambler wanted to convey the story‚Äôs messages in opera.\n\nThe real people of Salem, as they were portrayed in Charles W. Upham‚Äôs Salem Witchcraft (1867), are presented in this thesis. They are compared with Miller‚Äôs representations of these people as characters in a play, and then as characters in the libretto of Ward‚Äôs opera. The discussion of the decisions made by Ward and Stambler is enriched by personal opinions Ward expressed in interviews that were recorded for the purpose of this thesis. It is shown that Ward and Stambler considered characterisation to be a priority; Ward, as a composer, having a particular inclination to place special focus on the linear aspects of his works ‚Äì the words and the melodies. It is identified that in spite of the need to excise material from Miller‚Äôs play in order to facilitate the concise requirements of a libretto, Ward and Stambler included and excluded only what would serve the drama and their characterisation ‚Äì and if they felt that the original did not include the words they required, they wrote their own. \nAnalysis of the vocal melodies demonstrated that Ward used a number of standard and traditional compositional approaches to ensure that the melodies sung by his singers were true to their character. Again, this analysis was enhanced by Ward‚Äôs commentary which provided special insight into his compositional approach ‚Äì in particular, that he considered that his approach was one that was second nature and not one that considered special deliberation of every note.\n\nThis thesis presents The Crucible in a way that has not been considered before, from history to play and to opera. The thesis is a contribution to the history of American Opera and the work of Robert Ward, presenting for the first time, extensive commentary on his linear approach to characterisation and operatic composition.', '2017', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 15),
('witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing', 2, '3 Salem Girls (1692): Problems of Gender and Agency', 'E. Kent', 'When the Salem Village witch trials began early in 1692 there was very little to indicate that they were not like previous witch trials in New England.1 But instead of complaints against one, two, or even three witches, the Salem trials escalated massively until by late in the year over one hundred and fifty individuals had been accused, nineteen people had been executed and at least five others had died in jail.2 Between March and July accusations were focused in Salem Village. Between July and September, the focus shifted to neighbouring Andover. In all, over the course of 1692 twenty-six communities in Massachusetts had experienced witchcraft accusations.3 Salem witchcraft ‚Äúextended far beyond Salem Village to encompass large portions of Essex County and northern New England in general.‚Äù4 The single most important group of witchcraft accusers in these trials was a group of girls and teenage women, aged between nine and twenty years of age, who levelled accusations of witchcraft against women and men far superior to themselves in status and years. Young, female accusers were the main enactors of bewitchment in the courtroom and elsewhere. They provided a centrepiece for the theological exposition that accompanied the trials, and they were fundamental to the legal process. These ‚ÄòSalem Girls‚Äô have been written about extensively over several centuries, and since about the mid-twentieth-century have routinely been portrayed as psychologically disturbed or mentally ill. So in 1949 Marion Starkey, author of The Devil in Massachusetts, wrote that the young girls lived ‚Äúin dread of spectral rape by the incubus and of giving birth to a demon child.‚Äù5 In 1956 the historian', '2015', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 15),
('witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing', 3, 'Throwing Our Weight Around: Fat Girls, Protest, and Civil Unrest', 'Cat J. Paus√©, S. Grey', 'This article explores how fat women protesting challenges norms of womanhood, the place of women in society, and who has the power to have their say in public spaces. We use the term fat as a political reclamation; Fat Studies scholars and fat activists prefer the term fat, over the normative term ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù and the pathologising term ‚Äúobese/obesity‚Äù (Lee and Paus√© para 3). Who is and who isn‚Äôt fat, we suggest, is best left to self-determination, although it is generally accepted by fat activists that the term is most appropriately adopted by individuals who are unable to buy clothes in any store they choose. Using a tweet from conservative commentator Ann Coulter as a leaping-off point, we examine the narratives around women in the public sphere and explore how fat bodies might transgress further the norms set by society. The public representations of women in politics and protest are then are set in the context of ‚Äòactivist wisdom‚Äô (Maddison and Scalmer) from two sides of the globe. Activist wisdom gives preference to the lived knowledge and experience of activists as tools to understand social movements. It seeks to draw theoretical implications from the practical actions of those on the ground. In centring the experiences of ourselves and other activists, we hope to expand existing understandings of body politics, gender, and political power in this piece. It is important in researching social movements to look both at the representations of protest and protestors in all forms of media as this is the ‚Äòpublic face‚Äô of movements, but also to examine the reflections of the individuals who collectively put their weight behind bringing social change.A few days after the 45th¬†President of the United States was elected, people around the world spilled into the streets and participated in protests; precursors to the Women‚Äôs March which would take place the following January. Pictures of such marches were shared via social media, demonstrating the worldwide protest against the racism, misogyny, and overall oppressiveness, of the newly elected leader. Not everyone was supportive of these protests though; one such conservative commentator, Ann Coulter, shared this tweet:¬†Image1: A tweet from Ann Coulter; the tweet contains a picture of a group of protestors, holding signs protesting Trump, white supremacy, and for the rights of immigrants. In front of the group, holding a megaphone is a woman. Below the picture, the text reads, ‚ÄúWithout fat girls, there would be no protests‚Äù.Coulter continued on with two more tweets, sharing pictures of other girls protesting and suggesting that the protestors needed a diet programme. Kivan Bay (‚ÄúWithout Fat Girls‚Äù) suggested that perhaps Coulter was implying that skinny girls do not have time to protest because they are too busy doing skinny girl things, like buying jackets or trying on sweaters. Or perhaps Coulter was arguing that fat girls are too visible, too loud, and too big, to be taken seriously in their protests. These tweets provide a point of illustration for how fat women protesting challenge norms of womanhood, the place of women in society, and who has the power to have their say in public spaces While Coulter‚Äôs tweet was most likely intended as a hostile personal attack on political grounds, we find it useful in its foregrounding of gender, bodies and protest which we consider in this article, beginning with a review of fat girls‚Äô role in social justice movements.Across the world, we can point to fat women who engage in activism related to body politics and more. Australian fat filmmaker and activist Kelli Jean Drinkwater makes documentaries, such as Aquaporko! and Nothing to Lose, that queer fat embodiment and confronts body norms. Newly elected Ontario MPP Jill Andrew has been fighting for equal rights for queer people and fat people in Canada for decades. Nigerian Latasha Ngwube founded About That Curvy Life, Africa‚Äôs leading body positive and empowerment site, and has organised plus-size fashion show events at Heineken Lagos Fashion and Design Week in Nigeria in 2016 and the Glitz Africa Fashion Week in Ghana in 2017. Fat women have been putting their bodies on the line for the rights of others to live, work, and love.¬† American Heather Heyer was protesting the hate that white nationalists represent and the danger they posed to her friends, family, and neighbours when she died at a rally in Charlottesville, North Carolina in late 2017 (Caron). When Heyer was killed by one of those white nationalists, they declared that she was fat, and therefore her body size was lauded loudly as justification for her death (Bay, ‚ÄúHow Nazis Use‚Äù; Spangler).Fat women protesting is not new. For example, the Fat Underground was a group of ‚Äúradical fat feminist women‚Äù, who split off from the more conservative NAAFA (National Association to Aid Fat Americans) in the 1970s (Simic 18). The group educated the public about weight science, harassed weight-loss companies, and disrupted academic seminars on obesity. The Fat Underground made their first public appearance at a Women‚Äôs Equality Day in Los Angeles, taking over the stage at the public event to accuse the medical profession of murdering Cass Elliot, the lead singer of the folk music group, The Mamas and the Papas (Dean and Buss). In 1973, the Fat Underground produced the Fat Liberation Manifesto. This Manifesto began by declaring that they believed ‚Äúthat fat people are full entitled to human respect and recognition‚Äù (Freespirit and Aldebaran 341).Women have long been disavowed, or discouraged, from participating in the public sphere (Ginzberg; van Acker) or seen as ‚Äúintruders or outsiders to the tough world of politics‚Äù (van Acker 118). The feminist slogan the personal is political was intended to shed light on the role that women needed to play in the public spheres of education, employment, and government (Caha 22). Across the world, the acceptance of women within the public sphere has been varied due to cultural, political, and religious, preferences and restrictions (Agenda Feminist Media Collective). Limited acceptance of women in the public sphere has historically been granted by those ‚Äòanointed‚Äô by a male family member or patron (Fountaine 47).Anti-feminists are quick to disavow women being in public spaces, preferring to assign them the role as helpmeet to male political elite. As Schlafly (in Rowland 30) notes: ‚ÄúA Positive Woman cannot defeat a man in a wrestling or boxing match, but she can motivate him, inspire him, encourage him, teach him, restrain him, reward him, and have power over him that he can never achieve over her with all his muscle.‚Äù This idea of women working behind the scenes has been very strong in New Zealand where the ‚Äòsternly worded‚Äô letter is favoured over street protest.¬† An acceptable route for women‚Äôs activism was working within existing political institutions (Grey), with activity being ‚Äòhidden‚Äô inside government offices such as the Ministry of Women‚Äôs Affairs (Schuster, 23). But women‚Äôs movement organisations that engage in even the mildest form of disruptive protest are decried (Grey; van Acker).One way women have been accepted into public space is as the moral guardians or change agents of the entire political realm (Bliss; Ginzberg; van Acker; Ledwith). From the early suffrage movements both political actors and media representations highlighted women were more principled and conciliatory than men, and in many cases had a moral compass based on restraint. Cartoons showed women in the suffrage movement ‚Äòsweeping up‚Äô and ‚Äòcleaning house‚Äô (Sheppard 123). Groups like the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union were celebrated for protesting against the demon drink and anti-pornography campaigners like Patricia Bartlett were seen as acceptable voices of moral reason (Moynihan). And as Cunnison and Stageman (in Ledwith 193) note, women bring a ‚Äúculture of femininity to trade unions ‚Ä¶ an alternative culture, derived from the particularity of ', '2018', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 15),

Hasan', 'In Indian metaphysics, the legend of Khana and her husband Mihir illustrates how a praiseworthy trait for men can potentially become a blameworthy one for women. One day, as Mihir and his father were struggling to unravel an astrological question, Khana‚Äôs intervention helped them solve the problem right away. However, her superior intellect made Mihir apprehensive of the possible loss of his male superiority and power. Feeling threatened, Mihir reacted with antagonism and cut off her tongue in order to end her ability to express herself. Thus, instead of being appreciated, Khana‚Äôs superior knowledge encountered mistrust and hostility. Similar gendered double standard was prevalent in Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain‚Äôs (1880-1932) early twentieth-century Bengal where the pursuit of education and social work were considered commendable for men, but when she administered motivational work for her Sakhawat Memorial Girls‚Äô school, she was accused of flaunting and peddling her youthfulness by way of establishing an educational institution. This is because, while what Rokeya did was considered a male preserve, the association of women and evil was embedded in her cultural context. Rokeya depicts this in her fiction Padmarag (1924) where she brings about an assemblage of women on the premises of Tarini Bhaban in order to uncover their mental maps and to reveal their untold secrets and sufferings. Zaynab, Din Tarini, Saudamini, Helen, Quaresa, Usha, Rafia, Sakina and others sit together to unfurl and speak their minds among themselves. Through their reminiscences and memories, Rokeya lays bare the angst of women under a patriarchal social order. Most of these women at Tarini Bhaban are considered ‚Äòevil‚Äô beyond its premise in one way or another. For example, Saudamini is a stepmother with no biological children of her own. Within the stepfamily, she is regarded as a dakini (witch) and rakshasi (a female demon). Other women of Tarini Bhaban received comparable tags from society and have similar stories to tell.

('witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing', 5, 'Empowerment through Violence: Feminism and the Rape-Revenge Narrative in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo', 'J. Schorn', 'In this paper, I will focus exclusively on the rape of women by men. While men also fall victim to rape, the purpose of this paper is to explore the rape-revenge narrative and its potential as a feminist narrative that empowers abused women to fight not just their abuser, but a misogynic, patriarchal system at large. I follow Joanna Burkes definition of rape and sexual abuse as \"any act called such by a participant or third party\" (Burke 9).1 According to RAINN.org, the website of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, about one in six American women will experience rape or attempted rape in her lifetime. [1] It seems unsurprising, then, that rape and sexual assault are often the subject of movies, novels or TV series, and that news reports are frequently dominated by stories of grisly, brutal rapes. However, the cases that make it to our TV screens are hardly representative of reality. Though two thirds of all rapes are committed by someone well-known to the victim [2], often even a partner or friend, and are accompanied by manipulation and emotional abuse rather than physical force, the cases that receive the most media attention are typically those that involve physically violent stranger rape, such as the case of the Central Park Jogger. [3]2 This is both indicative of and a contributing factor to misconceptions about the nature and prevalence of rape. These common but often false ideas about how rape happens are called rape myths and have little to no factual basis. Joanna Burke describes rape myths as \"converting historical and geographical specificities into flaccid catchphrases that seem clear and self-evident, yet [...] profoundly damaging for people who suffer sexual abuse\" (Burke 24). She identifies some of the most common myths, which in addition to those named above, also include the idea that it is impossible to rape a woman who fights back (24), or that women routinely fabricate false rape claims to take revenge on men (28).3 These myths pertain not only to the identity of the rapist as a stranger and to the setting of the rape (a park, a dark alley, etc), but also to the supposed behavior of the rape victim. A rape victim, according to popular imagination, must be visibly traumatized in the immediate aftermath, and will continue to be profoundly damaged for the rest of her life. According to this logic, someone who appears calm, does not immediately seek help, and/or continues to interact with her rapist/victimizer cannot have been raped. We can see these dynamics at play in popular reactions to well-publicized rape allegations, such as in the cases against Dominique Strauss-Kahn or Julian Assange. Regardless of the actual events, which are known only to those involved, the media construction of the alleged victims in both cases serves to illustrate how the idea of the perfect or true victim influences the willingness to believe allegations of rape. The accuser in the Strauss-Kahn case, the hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, initially claimed to have sat in the hallway in shock for half an hour immediately following the assault. Later it was revealed that she called her fiance, and that she may have also continued cleaning another room. This, among other things, turned public opinion against her: if she was able to make phone calls and continue working, surely, she could not have been raped. [4] Similarly, public opinion did not side with the two Swedish women who raised sexual assault charges against Julian Assange. They were accused of lodging false charges for political reasons, and commentators on the case made much of the fact that both women had pursued sexual relationships with him and had continued to interact with him after the alleged assaults. \"Whats more, the following morning [...] the pair amicably went out to have breakfast together\", an incredulous journalist writes in a Daily Mail article at the time. [5]4 There are, however, countless complex dynamics at play that explain why some women do not report assaults right away, or at all. ‚Ä¶', '2013', 4, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 15),

We were introduced to Tiffany as a young 9-year-old in¬† The Wee Free Men , and followed her in sequels¬† A Hat Full of Sky and Wintersmith. She is no longer a little girl, but now a young lady who is the sole witch in her hometown of Chalk. This story revolves around the fact that there is a formidable and evil force that is turning the townspeople against witches (who may be considered good or bad in these books, depending on how they use their magic). Also known as ‚Äúthe Cunning Man,‚Äù this wicked figure first attacks Tiffany as she is on her way to inform Roland, the son and next-of-kin of the Baron, of the Baron‚Äôs recent death. The Cunning Man is supposedly the spirit of a man once slighted by a witch whom he loved, and his angry soul is devoted to exacting his revenge on the witches of the world. In this novel, it is up to Tiffany to come to terms with the Cunning Man and defeat him in order to restore order to her hometown. This fantasy book also brings in important themes that older children will be interested in and can relate to, with somewhat mature themes of unrequited love. It is revealed that Roland had been a love interest to Tiffany, but is now engaged to be married. While she initially battles with this and is somewhat bitter with the prospect, ultimately she comes to terms with what is happening and convinces herself it wasn‚Äôt meant to be. Later in the book, she starts a relationship with a guard named Preston, which will hopefully be developed further in books to come. Pratchett uses charming wordplay and puns that makes the book an interesting read. Comic relief comes in way of the Nac Mac Feegles ‚Äì mischievous little blue men who tend to follow Tiffany around and cause a ruckus, whom we first saw in The Wee Free Men . Originally intended to watch over her and make sure she‚Äôs safe, the Nac Mac Feegles have a way of getting into trouble by drinking and fighting; in this novel, they are accused of destroying a pub. These little men are quite rowdy and add to the ‚Äòmature‚Äô theme of the book, which help make it suitable for older children and pre-teens. Overall, this book is an interesting read ‚Äì one part Harry Potter and one part Monty Python. For older children who are fans of fantasy, this book would be an excellent choice; an added bonus is that reading the previous three novels isn‚Äôt a prerequisite for understanding and enjoying this installment. Pratchett‚Äôs unique writing style helps develop the imagination of the reader, though it is a bit slow in the beginning.

Dorr', 'IN HARPER LEES 1960 NOVEL, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, TOM ROBINSON, a crippled black man, is accused in 1935 of trying to rape a poor white woman in Maycomb, Alabama. Narrated by Scout Finch, a nine-year-old white girl and the daughter of Robinsons attorney, Atticus Finch, the trial reveals that rather than attempting to rape Mayella Ewell, Robinson is the victim of her sexual advances. When Mayellas father interrupted her seduction of Tom Robinson, he beat her and forced her to accuse Robinson of rape. Scout, realizing for the first time the ugly nature of race relations in the segregated South, informs the reader that Robinsons death is foreordained. \"Atticus had used every tool available to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of mens hearts Atticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouth and screamed.\"(1) Robinsons fictional experience parallels the experiences of many black men in the twentieth-century South, and Scout echoes many scholars conclusions when she claims that his death was inescapable. For historians, this sense of inevitability is so pervasive that it has shaped most analyses, not only of interracial sexual relations and lynching but also of race relations in the twentieth-century South. The words of Leon F. Litwack in 1998 recall those of Scout Finch: \"For a black man, a sexual advance to a white woman was a certain invitation to a tortured death.\"(2) Robinsons death may not have been as inevitable as Scout believed. Lee makes clear that the whites in Maycomb were divided along class lines about Tom Robinsons guilt. The rural farmers who composed the jury refused to consider Atticus Finchs appeals to rationality, and they found Robinson guilty. After the jurors had rendered their verdict, their role in the case was finished, The verdict was a catharsis--a performance that resolved the racial tensions raised by Mayella Ewells accusation. However, white legal authorities, whose class interests were not always aligned with those of the white jurors, controlled the disposition of Tom Robinsons sentence. Elite white men were skeptical of the accusations of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of poor, white \"trash.\" They believed, Lee implies, that the accusation against Robinson grew out of poisoned relations between blacks and poor whites rather than out of attempted rape. The judge and prosecuting attorney at trial made their opinions clear. Scout noticed throughout the trial that Mr. Gilmer, the prosecuting attorney, did not give the case his best effort. Atticus Finch, after the trial, commented on the attitude of the judge towards the Ewells: \"John [Taylor, the judge] made [Bob Ewell] look like a fool.... John looked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square egg. Dont tell me judges dont try to prejudice juries.\"(3) Despite the jurys apparent certainty of Robinsons guilt, Atticus Finch thought it likely that Robinsons conviction would be overturned on appeal. One might surmise that, given the different, class-based opinions about Robinsons guilt, had he not attempted to escape, as his guards claimed, he probably would not have been executed by the state. Class and gender tensions clouded issues of race and suggest that not all whites believed black men accused of assaulting white women should invariably pay with their lives. The possibility that guards staged Robinsons escape in order to mask their vigilante justice underscores this point.(4) Comparing fictional narratives with actual events, though useful, is complicated. Although fictional situations rarely conform exactly to actual events, Harper Lees exploration of race, class, and gender relations in a small southern town exposed how racial prejudice produced irrationality among whites, ultimately depriving African Americans of justice. As Atticus said, \"people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up.\"(5) To Kill A Mockingbird suggests that social prejudices, attitudes, and beliefs, controlled primarily by race and class attitudes, determined justice. ‚Ä¶', '2000', 10, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=witches+salemwitch+girl+girls+men+accused+accusing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 15),

The mobile monitoring system is automatically responsive to any move they detected as vehicles within the parking space along the rows of parking lots. Once detected, the captured images are processed using the MATLAB software. Any improperly parked cars detected, the cameras will identify their plate numbers, and snap and record it in a database. The designed prototype of the proposed system was tested in five presumed cases. In each case, ten images were processed, thus 50 images were eventually obtained. Out of the 50 images, 48 images corresponded to correct detection whereas the other two images corresponded to wrong detection.

('reuters+gas+prices+price+globally+global+lng', 1, 'Impact of Trends in Global LNG Supply and Demand on the European Gas Market in 2030', 'P. Eser, N. Chokani, R. Abhari', 'The increased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are one possible way for the EU to diversify its natural gas supply by 2030. However, as LNG is a globally traded commodity of limited abundance, other consumers‚Äô trends in LNG demand will impact the price and availability of LNG in Europe. This work couples a global LNG trade model to a high-resolution gas system model of the real European gas network to quantitatively assess the impact of possible different trends in global LNG supply and demand on the European gas market in 2030. It is found that by 2030, LNG from USA replaces Qatari LNG in the European gas market, while Qatari LNG supplies the increasing LNG demand in Asia. Due to the limited abundance of LNG supplies in 2030, the market penetration of Russian pipeline gas in Europe is found to increase by 50% compared to 2016. Further, it is found that the market share of LNG in the European gas market of 2030 is highly price sensitive, with a 10% reduction in LNG price leading to a doubling in market share. Such a 10% reduction in LNG prices is found to occur, if LNG demand in Asia is half that which is currently anticipated. This underlines the dependence of an LNG supply in Europe to trends in other markets of the world. Therefore contrary to general opinion, a strategy that relies on increased LNG imports is not necessarily politically less risky than a strategy that relies on increased imports of pipeline gas. INTRODUCTION Natural gas is planned to play a major role in Europe‚Äôs transformation towards a more environmentally friendly energy supply by 2030. According to recent projections of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG), the annual gas demand of the European Union will stay approximately constant until 2030 (ENTSOG, 2017). At the same time, the domestic gas production of the two largest gas producers within the EU, which are the Netherlands and the UK, is expected to decline by 50% (Netherlands) and 60% (UK) by 2030 (ENTSOG, 2017). Therefore, by 2030 a shortfall of gas is anticipated in the EU, which means that additional gas will need to be sourced from alternative suppliers. One option to cover this shortfall is the increased import of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which can be sourced via tankers from over a dozen countries globally. This diversity of LNG suppliers is attractive for the EU, because it provides an alternative to pipeline gas from Russia, which the EU seeks to become more independent from (Medlock et al., 2014); (Richter and Holz, 2015). At the same time, the shift of gas imports from Russia to LNG implies a risk for the EU, because current LNG prices are higher than Russian pipeline gas prices, and could stay so in future (Wood, 2012). The viability of covering the EU‚Äôs shortfall in gas supply with LNG depends not only on the development of the energy sector in Europe. Because LNG is a globally traded commodity, the market trends in the rest of the world also impact LNG prices in Europe. East Asia (mainly China and India) is anticipated to have a significant increase in LNG demand in the upcoming decades, putting pressure on the global LNG market (Wood, 2012); (Vivoda, 2014). Additionally, the East Asian gas markets are projected to move from oil-indexed gas pricing to more market-oriented gas-on-gas pricing, which would further increase the competitiveness of the LNG market (Shi, 2016). Since East Asia and Europe are approximately geographically equidistant from the main LNG suppliers in the Middle East, both regions are expected to compete directly for LNG shipments from the Middle East (Nikhalat-Jahromi et al., 2016); (Choi and Heo, 2017). At the same time, USA is increasing its domestic production of shale gas, which enables it to be a net exporter of LNG in future (Medlock et al., 2014); (Moryadee et al., 2014). All of the aforementioned trends will impact the price at which LNG will be available in the EU, which is found to be a key determinant for LNG‚Äôs future market share in the European gas market (Dorigoni et al., 2010). Therefore, it is crucial to model the global LNG', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=reuters+gas+prices+price+globally+global+lng&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 17),

Natural gas is increasingly becoming a main energy source in the region due to several factors. The global LNG pricing mechanism is changing towards flexible market related methods that might encourage some countries in MENA to switch to LNG supplies. The growing requirements for natural gas as a fuel for electricity generation is estimated to be the driving force behind the growth in consumption of the hydrocarbon. Contrary to wide held belief several countries in the region could fall into deficit regarding their self-supply of gas which would require them to import it. The options of supply are either through pipeline networks or LNG. The study estimates the future demand of natural gas by country using multivariate regression and then compares it to the availability of gas as estimated by GEFC. Deficit is derived for each country and the study indicate how the deficit could be filled through pipeline or LNG.', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=reuters+gas+prices+price+globally+global+lng&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 17),

Rogers', 'The aftermath of warmer than normal 2013/2014 winters in Europe and Asia, evidence of slowing Asian LNG demand growth through 2014 and the collapse of the oil price in late 2014 has resulted in a painful ‚Äònew normal‚Äô for key players in the global gas system, specifically LNG project investors and Russia/Gazprom. At one level we can rationalise the slowdown in Asian LNG demand and stagnant European gas demand as having a direct causal impact on European hub and LNG spot prices. The oil price fall has in parallel brought oil-indexed gas and LNG contract price levels down to levels unimaginable just two years ago. With project economics challenged and cashflows crimped, investors in new gas supply projects, especially LNG, will inevitably hold back, cut costs and await a more positive market outlook. At a more fundamental level however, what we may be about to witness is a significant disruption to regional gas equilibria as a wave of new (Australian) LNG supply meets a slowing Asian market and a significant regional component (US/North America) re-connects with the global system in the form of 77 bcma (and counting) of new LNG export projects. Europe will be a passive recipient of excess supply at a time when its gas demand growth is at best tepid, but its import requirement may be rising due to declining domestic production. This paper addresses the following questions: 1. What has been the impact of lower oil and lower gas prices on existing and future gas and LNG projects? 2. What is the outlook for the period to 2030 for markets connected by flexible LNG supplies given the uncertainty in regional demand outlooks in the light of new LNG supply currently under construction? 3. What is the impact of the probable delay to new LNG project FIDs given demand uncertainties and the apparent need to move from oil indexation to new contract price formation structures ? 4. To what extent can Russia, using its market power in Europe to ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô hub prices influence such outcomes? Through quantitative scenario analysis, the paper explores the major uncertainties in the global gas system connected by flexible LNG to 2030. The lack of clarity on Russia‚Äôs future preferred commercial behaviour however, adds a level of complexity most market participants would prefer to ignore.

We examined the possible fundamentals and used OLS methodology to estimate the linear regression model, which explained the development of TTF MA. We concluded the price based on factors determining marginal demand and supply. The most significant factors seemed to be the variables representing the price of German power and the price of coal since the competition between coal and gas in power generation determines the marginal demand, which sets the price for gas. The change in total demand was another significant factor, although its impact was smaller. The significance of the LNG variable indicated the exposure of European natural gas price to the global supply and demand.

However, the world‚Äôs largest growth potential among fossil fuels is attributed to liquefied natural gas (LNG). In the last few years, the U.S. rapidly increased LNG exports, and it is expected that they will further increase the liquefaction capacities. The cost of the LNG value chain is composed of the natural gas price in the country of origin, and the LNG process costs for liquefaction, transportation, storage, and regasification. Thus, the Henry Hub (HH) price in the U.S. is important for U.S. LNG exports to Western Europe. In this paper, gas flows in Western Europe at the beginning of the 2030s are analyzed if the price at HH is higher or lower than expected. Furthermore, the effect of the HH price on monthly U.S. LNG exports are studied. For the calculations, the global gas market model WEGA is used. The results reveal that the price at HH has a significant effect on annual gas flows in Western Europe and also on U.S. LNG exports during the summer. Furthermore, it is shown that pipeline gas in Western Europe will absorb fluctuations of U.S. LNG exports between the presented scenarios.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=reuters+gas+prices+price+globally+global+lng&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 17),

Herman, D. Brenner, Stewart Dandorf, S. Kemp, Breann Kroll, Joshua D Trebach, Y. Hsieh, A. Stolbach', 'In 2018, more than 48,000 Americans died from opioid overdose, with synthetic opioids such as fentanyl contributing to more than half [1, 2]. Public safety first responders, including law enforcement officers and emergency medical service (EMS) providers, encounter opioids in the field during law enforcement operation responses to opioid overdoses [3]. Because opioids kill by suppression of breathing, timely first responder response may be the difference between life and death. In 2016, commenters on an online medical toxicologist discussion forummade us aware of unverified reports that first responders themselves may be at risk from unintentional opioid exposure from small amounts of drug on patient clothing or in the air. These reports were attributed to lay media or discussions with EMS personnel. In response to similar reports, federal agencies issued guidance on addressing these potential exposures as early as 2016 [4, 5]. In September of that year, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) warned ‚Äúfentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder‚Äù [6]. In a June 2017 DEA video, the Acting Administrator advised not to touch fentanyl ‚Äúwithout the proper personal protective equipment‚Äù [7]. This statement was accompanied by an image of level A personal protective equipment (PPE), consisting of a positive pressure suit with self-contained breathing apparatus. The consensus of the scientific community remains that illness from unintentional exposures is extremely unlikely, because opioids are not efficiently absorbed through the skin and are unlikely to be carried in the air [8]. In a rare case report of law enforcement officer opioid exposure in a peer-reviewed literature, clinical manifestations were not consistent with opioids, and none of the law enforcement officers tested was positive for opioid metabolites [9]. In other words, the phenomenon of first responder opioid exposure that seemed to be frequently reported in news media has not been confirmed scientifically. Nevertheless, these media reports led to recommendations for higher level PPE for emergency responders. On the surface, it may seem like a reasonable, conservative recommendation to encourage emergency responders to wear maximum protective equipment if there is any small chance of unintentional opioid exposure. However, unnecessary PPE may delay emergency care to opioid-poisoned patients [4]. A short delay in response can be lethal for a patient who is not breathing. We wanted to investigate the initial lay media reports to understand where they came from and what they reported. We were curious to see how these media reports concluded first responder exposure when we could not find any confirmation in the scientific literature. Using a team of five reviewers, we searched LexisNexis for English-language print and online lay publications on first responder opioid exposure published in North America between January 2012 and March 2018. We randomly assigned articles to one of the five reviewers who used a standardized data collection form. We set aside articles that did not mention a specific case of first responder exposure. (Many articles discussed the issue without reporting a specific case.) If the article reported an exposure to a first responder, the reviewers recorded the route of exposure, the documented clinical manifestations, and whether any confirmatory drug testing was described. Our initial search yielded 1408 articles, but after review, only 1016 were relevant to the topic of first responder opioid exposure. Of the relevant articles, 214 actually described first responder opioid exposure.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of using diverted POs on fentanyl exposure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing data from two prospective community-recruited cohorts of people who use drugs (PWUD) in Vancouver, Canada, we estimated the independent relationship between using diverted POs and fentanyl exposure (assessed through urine drug test [UDT]) between 2016 and 2018. We also explored if participant characteristics modified this relationship.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the study period, among 1150 participants, 241 (21.0%) reported using diverted POs in 292 (12.8%) occasions. In adjusted analyses, PWUD using diverted POs had decreased odds of fentanyl exposure (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.94).

This reduced likelihood was primarily observed among PWUD with morphine positive UDT, which could partially be explained by longer duration of action and lower street cost of slow-release oral morphine relative to other POs and fentanyl.

Further, there is a persistent belief that PWUD are not willing or able to change their behaviors despite being aware of their potential exposure to fentanyl through drug use.MethodsWe conducted a multi-site cross-sectional study among PWUD to assess what behaviors, if any, were employed in the case of suspected fentanyl exposure, and the correlates of engaging in harm reduction behaviors (HRB). PWUD (N = 334) were recruited in Boston (n = 80), Providence (n = 79), and in Baltimore (n = 175). At the time of the survey, no legal drug checking services were available in these cities.ResultsThe majority of PWUD (84%) expressed concern about fentanyl. Among those who suspected fentanyl exposure prior to using their drugs (n = 196), 39% reported employing HRB including using less of the drug (12%) or abstaining altogether (10%), using more slowly (5%), and doing a tester shot (5%). In adjusted logistic regression models, the odds (aOR) of practicing HRB after suspecting fentanyl exposure were increased among PWUD who were non-White (aOR 2.1; p = 0.004) and older (aOR 1.52 per decade of age; p < 0.001).

In the multivariable analysis, OAT dissatisfaction was positively associated with fentanyl exposure (AOR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.34; 95% CI: 1.08‚Äì1.66). Conclusions A substantial proportion of OAT patients in our sample reported dissatisfaction with their OAT, and more than half were exposed to fentanyl. We also found that those who were dissatisfied with their OAT were more likely to be exposed to fentanyl. These findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing OAT satisfaction in the context of the ongoing opioid overdose crisis.', '2021', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+fentanyl+reported+reports+reportedly+report+reporting+opioid+opioids+exposure&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 18);

Since Jokowi became the President, he brings back again the issue about moving the capital city of Indonesia from Jakarta. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned any specific place as the new capital city, and he only said that moving the capital city from Jakarta is still in the study stages. This statement automatically gains vast attention from the media, especially online media. Hundreds of news, comments from experts, government, and from local people about this issue spread in media. The media then construct the news about Palangka Raya as the new capital city of Indonesia. The purpose of this paper is to analyze news text published by national media online about the issue on moving the capital city to Palangka Raya. The analysis grounded in Norman Fairclough‚Äôs critical discourse analysis approach as a major theory. The analysis uses the text description, discourse practice (interpretation), and social practice (explanation). The description of the text will show the news text structure, the title of the news, the orientation, the sequence of even, and the closing part. The main theme in the news text is moving the capital city to Palangka Raya as the response from journalists on Jokowi statement about the study in moving the capital city from Jakarta. The grammatical analysis will focus on the words chosen by the journalists in the news text that represents their ideology. The interpretation analysis will show what the issue was, who was involved in that issue, what the relationship is and what the role of the language in the news text. The explanation analysis shows the situation when the issue about moving the capital city to Palangka Raya become the headline in the media online and the influence of the institution (government, experts, local people) to the production of the text.

('seattle+citys+city+news+said+officers', 6, 'One mans campaign in The inner city news: Bruce Hucker (1979 to 1990)', 'D. Haigh', 'AbstractBruce Hucker wrote a weekly article for the Inner City News between 1979 and 1990. Hucker took issue with Auckland City Council on many issues and accused the Citizens and Ratepayers group that ran council of being nothing other than a local branch of the National Party. He wrote on housing, unemployment and the need to democratise council. These issues are as pertinent today as they were then.In addition to local issues, he spoke out against the Springbok tour, racism and discrimination at Government level, and the destruction of Aucklands CBD heritage. When Hucker became deputy mayor of Auckland City Council in the 1990s, he gave greater emphasis to community development, heritage protection, urban design and long term planning.\"To hold a pen is to be at war.\" VoltaireThe Inner City News operated from 1979 to 1990. Although it was set up as a private company, it operated as a cooperative with all those involved being initially unpaid volunteers (Nicola Legat, Katy Reid, Elizabeth Raea & Bruce Hucker). Its main office and printing room was the basement of a members home who also served as editor. Door to door deliveries were carried out by family members and supporters and copy written on a weekly basis by members. It started with some seeding funds from the Freemans Bay Community Committee, a community organisation that often did not see eye to eye with Auckland City Council. While being a cooperative, it still had to deal with day-to-day business matters like the purchase of printing equipment and finding advertising revenues. It is notable that, over the years, the quality of the newspaper print improved and the circulation grew. The idea to establish an independent press arose out of the dissatisfaction with the newsletter produced by the Freemans Bay Community Committee. This dissatisfaction was the limited size of the newsletter and control over content by the Auckland City Council. Reflecting on this period, Hucker said, \"If you empower people you disempower politicians and their bureaucracies\" (Personal communication).The first edition (October 1979) and the two that followed, contained a number of social issues including a story about Jack Watson who had had his home compulsorily purchased by council. He was seeking a price based on the principle of a home for a home at least up to local body standard. Housing was also the story behind a report by outgoing housing social worker for council, Pat Hanley, on the cost and shortage of housing. There was a short biography of the old campaigner, Johnny Mitchell, who, amongst many civic activities, campaigned against the Freemans Bay urban renewal project. These were followed by articles about a womens refuge, a community garden in Ireland Street, the Auckland Womens Health Centre, and the Tongan Kings opening a new church and an article on how to set up a vegie cooperative. It was a promising beginning.While the Inner City News was practical in its purpose, in ideological terms it was linked to the mutualist and distributist concepts of Chesterton and Belloc who opposed a press owned by the wealthy. Belloc, in the opening statement to his book The Free Press said:I propose to discuss in what follows the evil of the great modern capitalist press putting power into ignoble hands; its correction by the formation of small independent organs, and the probably increasing effect of these last. (p.2)Belloc went on to say, It (the press) also began to arise contemporaneously with capitalism and finance: it has grown with them and served them. Belloc, H. p.2). Belloc and Chesterton were strong advocates of community owned businesses and cooperatives in the tradition of catholic social theory, a theory that lost its impetus, particularly in Britain following the death of GK Chesterton, but is now being promoted by Pope Francis.Eventually the four founders sold the Inner City News to an ex-Herald journalist who in turn after a number of years sold it to the Harbour News. ‚Ä¶', '2015', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=seattle+citys+city+news+said+officers&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 19),

St. Luke‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Seattle is all that. The century-long history of St. Luke‚Äôs has seen seasons of growth and others tainted with the aroma of decay. Currently it is a modest-sized congregation of diverse ages, worshiping in a space shared with a variety of organizations. Volunteers serve breakfast on site each day of the week at the church through its Edible Hope meal program. Many of us who gather on Sunday mornings are white and educated. Many of us are‚Äîor at least grew up‚Äîmiddle class. One would not imagine that such a humble site with its centenarian chapel, mid-century meeting hall, and cottages in need of fresh paint could be a site of neighborhood contention, but in a growing city such as Seattle where disputes on homelessness draw impassioned responses on all sides, the simple act of offering a meal draws some very negative attention. Location matters for a church that occupies a significant portion of a city block amidst construction cranes and new townhomes. In comment sections on news blogs and from newcomers posting on neighborhood apps the church has been blamed and targeted as the source of problems. In addition to the indirect accusations, the church office receives countless calls and emails making various complaints and threats‚Äîone of which resulted in the implementation of rat control procedures, suggesting that there is a thin line differentiating who or what is considered a pest. Nevertheless, following the conviction of a number of longtime members, and now under the pastoral guidance of The Rev. Canon Britt Olson, there remains a quiet resolve to serve all neighbors regardless of what others may believe. Around the city of Seattle the contrast between housed and unhoused persons is stark. Homeless encampments, that in past years had been largely hidden from sight under bridges or overpasses, are cleared and then fenced, pushing individuals into public view. Meanwhile, empty lots that were once considered too industrial or too distant from neighborhood centers, give way to piles upon piles of building materials. As 2018 real estate prices peaked in the summer heat, the Seattle Times published an article declaring a huge increase in homelessness and in anger from residents. The Ballard neighborhood, among others around Seattle, is reeling from significant change in a short time‚Äîsingle family homes and small businesses are giving way to seven-story luxury apartments and upscale gyms‚Äîand this has fomented a clash of ideals.

Baker, Allyson McKinney Timm', 'In 2017, the Trump Administration imposed its policy of zero-tolerance immigration enforcement on the southern border. This policy resulted in the forcible separation of families and the prolonged detention of children in harsh conditions, without due process or adequate resources. The Trump Administration unleashed these policies to deter people from immigrating and seeking asylum, consistent with President Trump‚Äôs racist rhetoric and campaign promises. This article analyzes and critiques these policies based on international human rights law, noting the resonance human rights norms find among diverse religious traditions. \n \nThe article begins with detailed analysis of the Trump Administration‚Äôs policies that divided families and detained children in wretched conditions, in violation of U.S. law. It proceeds to evaluate and criticize these policies under treaties ratified by the U.S., conventions it has signed but not ratified, and established customary international law. In the name of border enforcement and immigration deterrence, the Trump Administration‚Äôs policies violated the fundamental human rights of migrants and people seeking asylum in the United States, including the right to family life, rights of the child, and rights to be free from ill-treatment and arbitrary detention. The abrupt and often permanent separation of families, the indefinite detention of children without proper care, and the failure of process in these policies are all stark violations of binding international human rights laws. These policies affront the moral conscience of multitudes, eliciting sustained protest from civil society and faith leaders. \n \nThe article concludes with a recognition that international institutions and legal mechanisms may not be adequate to compel the Trump Administration to respect international law, so political and electoral responses are vital to ensure that human rights remain at the heart of the American enterprise. It suggests the accord between religious, ethical perspectives and human rights principles is valuable to reinforcing popular support for these norms.

This system is currently being scaled up to be tested on hundreds of canine puppies by a preeminent guide dog school in the US. As a result, the design emphasis here has been on the cost and power reduction, comfortable ergonomics, user friendliness, and robustness of data streaming. We expect the system to provide continuous quantitative data for improving guide dog training programs in addition to contributing the well-being of other working dogs in the future.', '2020', 2, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=collar+barking+bark+dogs+dog+ghost+email&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

The barking of dogs is one sound that most of us can do without. Of course, dogs don‚Äôt just bark, they make other sounds that can irritate us such as howling, yelping, growling and whining. As the Spring weather gets better, dogs will be outside more and there will be more things and people to trigger the vocalizing. Dogs vocalize for a variety of reasons. We need to understand that barking and making these other sounds is normal behavior and is what dogs do. They may bark excitedly seeing children walking near their house, or they may howl in response to other dogs they hear howling, or they may growl and bark threatening other dogs or people that come near the house, or they may howl in fear of storms or being left alone. Despite what we may think, they don‚Äôt bark for the fun of it or just to irritate us. What can be done to stop obnoxiously vocalizing dogs? If it‚Äôs a neighbor‚Äôs dog, perhaps you need to have a friendly conversation with them to let them know of the problem. Some owners honestly don‚Äôt know their dog is a problem barker. If talking to the neighbor doesn‚Äôt help, you can call your local animal control agency. Most communities have ordinances about nuisance barking. If the problem barker is your dog, you will need some knowledge of what causes the barking in order to effectively control it. If the dog is barking in response to exciting things or situations, like people walking by the house or things the dog hears, sometimes you can remove the dog from the source of the exciting things by keeping the dog in the house or in a well-ventilated garage or restricting him to a part of the yard where he can‚Äôt see or hear the exciting things. Electronic anti-bark collars can also be effective in stopping excitement barking. For dogs that are vocalizing out of fear of things or being left alone, bark collars won‚Äôt work and restriction may not help. The best way to stop the vocalizing is to get help from your veterinarian or a behaviorist to reduce the dog‚Äôs fears. Muzzling the dog is not an appropriate way to stop barking and can result in injury or death.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=collar+barking+bark+dogs+dog+ghost+email&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 21),

Owners rated the frequency of their dogs barking on a scale ranging from 1 (very infrequent) to 5 (very frequent) before the study began (pre-treatment condition) and at the end of every week that the collar was worn (treatment condition). A further evaluation was made at the end of week 4, following 7 days of collar deprivation (post-treatment condition). Dogs exhibited a significantly lower frequency of barking during the treatment and post-treatment conditions compared to the pre-treatment condition. Barking was most effectively reduced when dogs wore the collar intermittently. However, barking increased over the period of time the collar was worn, particularly in those dogs which wore the device every day. Barking continued to increase when the dogs stopped wearing the collar, albeit at frequencies lower than pre-treatment, particularly in those animals which had worn the collar continuously. The collar was more effective at reducing travel related barking than television or traffic related barking. Findings indicate that dogs generally habituate to the citronella spray collar irrespective of how the animal is exposed to the device. A longer period of efficacy occurs, however, if the collar is worn intermittently.

The main goal of this study was to characterize the everyday use of e‚Äêcollars by dog owners, in France where there are currently no regulations on their use. A sample (n = 1,251) of dog owners were recruited using an online questionnaire. Data were collected using Google Forms. Factors associated with the use of e‚Äêcollars were determined using a Chi‚Äêsquared test. Twenty‚Äêsix percent (n = 330) of the owners enrolled in this survey did use such devices; 11.9% (n = 149) of the owners reported the use of bark‚Äêactivated collars, 4.5% (n = 56) reported the use of electronic boundary fence collars, and 14.2% (n = 178) reported the use of remote‚Äêcontrolled collars. E‚Äêcollar use was found to be significantly associated with 3 factors: dogs weighing over 40 kg, non‚Äêneutered status, and dogs used for hunting or security activities. In addition, the data collected showed that e‚Äêcollars were mainly used on young dogs (<2 years). The vast majority of e‚Äêcollar users (71.8%) used the collar without professional advice, and 75% of e‚Äêcollar users tried 2 or fewer other solutions before using the collar. Seven percent of the dogs on which the collar was used presented with physical wounds (n = 23). The efficacy reported was lower than that in many previous studies where conditions of use as specified were designed to be ideal as part of the experimental design (qualified trainer, perfect timing). All collar types were not equal: bark‚Äêactivated collars appeared to be the least efficient and the most injurious type, whereas remote‚Äêcontrolled collars were mainly used for owners convenience. In conclusion, this survey highlights a high ratio of e‚Äêcollar use in a country without regulations. It also shows that real‚Äêlife conditions are far from the idealized conditions in which experimental studies were undertaken, thereby putting dog welfare at higher risk than what is presented in scientific literature. In addition, this study reveals differences between collar types in terms of efficacy and effects on welfare. These factors should be taken into account to determine a precise regulation.

Prasada', 'Kind representations draw an important distinction between properties that are understood as existing in instances of a kind by virtue of their being the kind of thing they are and properties that are not understood in this manner. For example, the property of barking for the kind dog is understood as being had by dogs by virtue of the fact that they are dogs. These properties are said to have a principled connection to the kind. In contrast, the property of wearing a collar is not understood as existing in instances by virtue of their being dogs, despite the fact that a large percentage of dogs wear collars. Such properties are said to have a statistical connection to the kind. Two experiments tested two signatures of principled connections in 4-7‚ÄØyear olds and adults: (i) that principled connections license normative expectations (e.g., we judge there to be something wrong with a dog that does not bark), and (ii) that principled connections license formal explanations which explain the existence of a property by reference to the kind (e.g., that barks because it is a dog). Experiment 1 showed that both the children and adults have normative expectations for properties that have a principled connection to a kind, but not those that have a mere statistical connection to a kind. Experiment 2 showed that both children and adults are more likely to provide a formal explanation when explaining the existence of properties with a principled connection to a kind than properties with statistical connections to their kinds. Both experiments showed no effect of age (over ages 4, 7, and adulthood) on the extent to which participants differentiated principled and statistical connections.

The statement certainly feels like a warning, but it is a warning that comes with a prescription that carries optimism and hope The warning that the virus will ‚Äútake on the world‚Äù has indeed been the world‚Äôs experience during the first year of COVID-19 But the warning is more ominous with the continual emergence of variants of the coronavirus that have differing characteristics ‚Äì transmission speed, pathogenicity, evasion of immunity to prior infection or immunization (1) Viruses do not have wants or desires;viruses do not have goals or objectives;and viruses do not have plans for the future However, viruses are in the realm of the living, they do replicate (with the host‚Äôs machinery), and they evolve in directions that favor their continued existence As long as their continued existence threatens human health, they are taking on the world Why should the world‚Äôs sharing of vaccines be part of the solution? What contribution can COVID-19 vaccines make? How confident should we be in the ability of vaccines to stop these viruses? Virus evolution is dependent on mutations that arise during replication in a host that are transmitted to others, creating subtly and sometime not-so-subtly different lineages that can have selective advantage Stopping replication stops evolution Preventing infection prevents replication Preventing transmission prevents infection To the extent that vaccines are able to decrease the amount of viral replication, viral infection, and viral transmission, the pace of evolution should be able to be slowed, slowing generation of variants, and slowing the virus‚Äô taking on of the world Can vaccines do that? The current COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use based on their proven ability to prevent clinical disease, not their ability to prevent transmission and infection However, animal models in preclinical trials showed evidence of prevention of transmission, and evidence is emerging that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission Seeing the large decreases of COVID-19 with widespread use of COVID-19 vaccine in Israel is a good sign with real world evidence (2) We are likely to see more and more evidence that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission as the world has more experience with the vaccines Based on other routinely-used vaccines, one would expect the COVID-19 vaccines to have some effectiveness against infection and transmission Look at hepatitis A in China The number of infections is hundreds of times lower than in the pre-vaccine era after use of hepatitis A vaccines;fewer infections mean fewer replications Even inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which is often said to not be effective against infection/transmission, has epidemiologically meaningful effectiveness against infection/transmission (3) Several European countries eliminated polioviruses with IPV alone Last year, China stopped a three-year-old outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 with Sabin-strain IPV alone (4) These accomplishments would not have been possible without vaccine effectiveness against infection/transmission Will vaccines cause selection of vaccine-escape mutants? One would expect that viruses less neutralized by vaccines to have selective advantage over viruses more susceptible to vaccine-induced immunity However, this is not a reason to not vaccinate The contribution of selection pressure leading to meaningful vaccine escape is not known Every year, influenza vaccine is changed in attempt to match the upcoming circulating strains, but the reason that circulating strains change is not from vaccine selection pressure, but rather from genetic drift that happens with or without vaccination Virus replication anywhere is a threat everywhere Not only is ongoing transmission a risk to health where it is happening, but also a risk to other places to which the virus can travel This is in part the reason for the World Health Organization‚Äôs (WHO) call for solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic Along with promoting the development of COVID-19 vaccines, WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, and Gavi created COVAX, a mechanism for sharing vaccines globally Almost all countries of the world have signed onto COVAX, and indeed COVAX has already started sharing COVID-19 vaccines (5) Strengthening COVAX with financing and vaccine supports sharing the vaccine with the world As George Gao says, sharing vaccines with the world is important to prevent the virus from taking on the world Vaccines alone, of course, are not enough Constant vigilance and sensitive surveillance of circulating coronavirus is absolutely essential The first generation of vaccines may need to be updated to keep up with, and ideally get ahead of virus evolution by finding additional vaccine targets Population immunity will need to be frequently assessed against circulating strains and tested for waning immunity Vaccination policies will need to be adjusted as the epidemiology changes Ensuring availability and large-scale use of COVID-19 vaccines by all countries, in solidarity against the COVID-19 pandemic, is a vital strategy to prevent the virus from taking on the world', '2021', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=says+say+ads+ad+time+times+likely+like+vaccines+vaccinated+vaccinating+vaccine&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 22),

It is based on antigens that makeup the RTS acronym‚Äîthe central tandem repeat (R) from the CSP, epitopes from the CSP carboxy-terminal (T); and the surface (S) antigen of hepatitis B virus‚Äîgenetically engineered into the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) platform. When co-expressed in yeast, the fusion protein spontaneously forms virus-like particles with free HBsAgs, which are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, priming the immune system. The vaccine‚Äôs novel adjuvant also stimulates T helper cell responses and further activates macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells. The adjuvant AS01 is a liposomal formulation of the monophosphoryl lipid A and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21, the latter an extract from the soap bark tree, a Chilean evergreen. Together, vaccine and adjuvant prompt an immune response designed to intercept the parasite in circulation before it travels to the liver, where it multiplies, eventually releasing parasites back into the bloodstream and causing malarial symptoms. Overall, it‚Äôs likely antibodies to CSP carry most, if not all, of the parasite-fighting load, though a small response by CD8+ T cells can‚Äôt be ruled out, says Eleanor Riley, professor of infectious disease immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Protection is mostly down to higher antibody titers to CSP, as these correlate to better vaccine responses. That response with Mosquirix is ‚Äúabout as good as it‚Äôs going to get,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo make this vaccine better it would be necessary to add in more antigens to broaden the immune response and to really target in the liver those few sporozoites that make it there.‚Äù GSK began work on the present RTS,S vaccine in the late 1980s, in conjunction with the Walter Reed Medical Research Institute in Silver Spring, Maryland. The British drug-maker spent much of the 1990s working to improve the performance of the vaccine by tweaking the adjuvant, eventually incorporating the AS01 adjuvant system in the later part of that decade. Since 2001, the vaccine has been developed by GSK and PATH, with $200 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. GSK says it has invested $350 million so far developing Mosquirix and expects to spend an additional $260 million to complete the project. GSK published final phase 3 trial results for Mosquirix in April 2015 (Lancet 386, 31‚Äì45, 2015). A three-dose schedule of the vaccine followed by a booster 18 months later reduced the number of cases of clinical malaria by 36% in children aged 5‚Äì17 months and by 26% in infants aged 6‚Äì12 weeks, over an average 48 months and 38 months across trial sites, In a major public health milestone, European regulators have for the first time delivered a positive scientific opinion of a vaccine against malaria. The European Medicines Agency (EMA)‚Äôs decision paves the way for a policy recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) for vaccinating children in sub-Saharan Africa. The vaccine, Mosquirix (also known as RTS,S/AS01), from Londonbased GlaxoSmithKline, is the result of three decades of development. Although the vaccine‚Äôs efficacy is limited, its public health value could be particularly great for children in hightransmission areas where mortality is very high. GSK received the regulatory nod from the EMA‚Äôs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in late July. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big scientific achievement,‚Äù says David Kaslow, vice president of product development at PATH, an international nonprofit organization for global health, located in Seattle, Washington. ‚ÄúThis is the first time a vaccine has shown a favorable benefitrisk profile against malaria,‚Äù says Kaslow. The European agency recommended Mosquirix to prevent malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum in children aged 6 weeks to 17 months. The positive opinion provides much-needed proof that a vaccine is possible. GSK ran multicenter trials in partnership with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative in 15,459 participants at 11 sites in seven subSaharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. ‚ÄúIt was never entirely clear if it was biologically possible to develop a malaria vaccine,‚Äù says Kaslow. The parasite has 5,000 genes and three distinct life cycle stages, which makes it difficult to identify targets for the immune system to attack. ‚ÄúThis is a wily parasite,‚Äù he says, one that has evolved and shifted in response to malarial therapies and insecticides. Work in the 1980s by wife-and-husband team of Ruth and Victor Nussenzweig at New York University first showed that the target for protective antibodies is the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on the of sporozoites at the liver stage, after the malaria parasite is inoculated into humans. This discovery set the stage for a human vaccine. But more than a dozen different vaccines made using different technologies, including synthetic peptides, DNA constructs, adjuvants and delivery systems, failed to offer enough protection. Although all induced low levels of antibodies it became clear that to increase protection, the vaccine had to generate a more potent antibody response and a T-cell response.

Williams, a wildlife biologist with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, has just transferred the animal from a trap to a plastic bag containing a cotton ball doused in anaesthetic. As soon as the mouse‚Äôs breathing slows to one breath per second, Williams will take it out, draw blood, weigh it, put an ear tag on it for identification and check the animal for ticks, saving any that are engorged with blood. He must work quickly. The mouse will wake up in about two minutes, and she might be grumpy. Williams is testing whether vaccinating mice against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, can reduce the proportion of ticks that are infected. Health officials are looking on with interest. Connecticut has one of the highest rates of human Lyme disease in the country, and June is peak time for transmission. Borrelia burgdorferi infects an estimated 329,000 people in the United States each year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. And although most people who get prompt treatment recover quickly ‚Äî Williams has had Lyme three times ‚Äî up to one in five develops long-term and potentially life-threatening symptoms, including heart, vision or memory problems, or debilitating joint pain. Williams‚Äôs approach is one of several strat egies being tested in an attempt to thwart the spread of tick-borne diseases. Some, like the mouse vaccine, interrupt the pathogen‚Äôs ecological circuitry by targeting the wild animals that pass along and amplify the disease. Others, such as efforts to revive a human Lyme vaccine, aim to protect people from infection directly. A more radical approach could hamper the ability of ticks to bite humans or animals, potentially protecting against dozens of illnesses spreading across the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia. That the field needs creative solutions is clear. Many long-recommended interventions, such as pesticide application or controlling populations of deer, which are an important host for adult ticks, have had mixed success in scientific studies. Even the time-honoured protective strategies that most people use are not evidence-based. ‚ÄúWe tell people to wear repellents, to do tick checks and to shower if they‚Äôve been in the field, but there‚Äôs very little data to show that these things reduce human illness,‚Äù explains Ben Beard, chief of the CDC‚Äôs bacterial-diseases branch in the division of vector-borne diseases. Diseases spread by ticks are on the rise around the world, spurred by a combination of factors, including shifting climates and population sprawl into rural areas. Reported cases of Lyme, the most common US tick-borne illness, have nearly tripled in the country since 1992, although some of the increase could be due to heightened awareness. Lyme is also a growing problem in parts of Europe, Mongolia and China. Yet as bad as it is, there are nastier threats on the rise. In parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia and southern Europe, ticks can spread Crimean‚ÄìCongo haemorrhagic fever, which is fatal in 40% of cases. And a tick-borne relapsing fever afflicts as many as 1 in 20 residents in parts of Senegal. In the United States, ticks spread at least 16 illnesses, including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, all ‚Äúserious, life-threatening infections‚Äù, Beard says. And many are increasing in incidence more quickly than Lyme. In a July 2015 position statement, the Entomological Society of America argued for a national strategy to combat tick-borne diseases. ‚ÄúThe recent confluence of environmental, ecological, sociological, and human demographic factors,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúhas created a near ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô leading to more ticks in more places throughout North America.‚Äù', '2015', 22, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=says+say+ads+ad+time+times+likely+like+vaccines+vaccinated+vaccinating+vaccine&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 22),

But the finding that the vaccine, called V520, seemed to make some study participants more susceptible to the disease was a shocking coup de gr√¢ce that has had a chilling effect on vaccine research using adenovectors. ‚ÄúNo one expected this,‚Äù says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey‚Äì based Merck trial, participants that had higher levels of preexisting immunity to the disabled cold virus used as a vector in the vaccine were more likely than those with lower immunity to become HIV infected. Although it‚Äôs impossible for researchers to say whether the results are meaningful, speculative hypotheses abound and the results sent ripples through a vaccine community already dissatisfied with the vector, called adenovirus 5 (Ad5). From a developmental standpoint, Ad5 was the logical choice: researchers have been safely working with it for decades, and there are few vector alternatives ready for the clinic. Considering that the trial was a proofof-concept study evaluating the use of T-cell vaccines, researchers deemed it best to get the vaccine itself into the field as quickly as possible. But the vector has its limitations. Because humans encounter it frequently in their everyday environment, there are substantial levels of preexisting immunity to the vector, which could potentially disable it before unloading its cargo. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anybody wants to use Ad5 in humans,‚Äù says Jonathan Bramson, who studies genetic vaccines at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre using it because they have to.‚Äù The Merck trial originally was designed to vaccinate only those with low Ad5 immunity, but researchers lifted that restriction after animal studies showed that proposed doses were likely high enough to overcome the preexisting immunity. Besides, study designers had good reason to take the chance on expanding enrollment: >80% of sub-Saharan Africans (a population with a large need for a vaccine) have high levels of Ad5 immunity. The results from the Merck trial are ‚Äúgoing to push people to come up with strategies in which preexisting immunity is not going to be a problem,‚Äù says Gary Kobinger of the National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Manitoba. It‚Äôs not clear what those strategies are, but researchers have been discussing a return to excluding those with high preexisting immunity in future trials, says Gary Nabel, director of the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center. For diseases like HIV and Ebola, that will mean leaving out a large part of the population that stands to benefit most from HIV vaccines. Although that sacrifice is unfortunate, ‚Äúthese are not licensure trials. We‚Äôre not going to get 95% efficacy with just one vaccine trial,‚Äù says Lawrence Corey, lead researcher on the Merck HIV vaccine trial. ‚ÄúAd5 is not likely to emerge as the vaccine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean testing the adenovirus prototype is wrong.‚Äù There are suggestions that using the Ad5 vector in a ‚Äúprime-boost‚Äù system could reduce the influence of preexisting immunity, and some upcoming HIV vaccine trials by the NIH will explore that option. In the NIH trial, volunteers are given three shots of naked DNA plasmid vaccine, followed by one shot of a vaccine that uses Ad5 in the hope that the first shots of naked DNA‚Äîthough not likely to be a strong vaccine on their own‚Äîwill ready the immune system for the final Ad5 shot. The response to that final shot is then boosted, so as to be strong enough to overcome any vaccine that is eliminated by preexisting Ad5 immunity. This approach holds a second advantage: the Ad5 vector will be given only once, rather than three times as it was in the Merck study. Even so, the NIH trials have been put on hold while researchers decide how best to respond to the Merck data. ‚ÄúNeedless to say, we have put things on pause,‚Äù says Nabel. ‚ÄúAlmost without question there will be changes in the design of that trial.‚Äù A patient receives an experimental cancer vaccine.

Durham, D. Swayne', 'tions of poultry and humans have caused the world to be on alert for a pandemic. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) veterinary medical officer and laboratory director David Swayne and his team at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, are developing new viral-vectored vaccines to facilitate vaccine efficiency against avian influenza. A vector is a biological carrier of genes of another pathogen. Vectors such as the turkey herpesvirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and adenoviruses are being used and could allow mass application of vaccine. Development of new vaccines will help to protect birds and humans in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in the United States. ‚ÄúMass-application technologies, like a spray or in ovo injection, for new viral or bacterial vector systems will provide economic incentives for adoption over current labor-intensive, manual, individual-bird injection methods used today,‚Äù says Swayne. Swayne and his research team are working with Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to develop a spray vaccine for avian influenza that uses the Newcastle disease virus as a vector. ‚ÄúThis combination allows us to use one vaccination that will protect against both avian influenza and Newcastle disease,‚Äù says Swayne. Another collaboration with Meriel, Inc., of Athens, Georgia, is using fowl pox as a vector for avian influenza virus, yielding one vaccine that lends protection for both of those diseases. ‚ÄúWe are also working with the University of Pittsburgh and Vaxin, Inc., of Birmingham, Alabama, to develop vaccines using adenoviruses as vectors,‚Äù says Swayne. The common cold is caused by an adenovirus. The avian influenza gene is inserted into the adenovirus, and the preparation can be injected into individual birds or potentially sprayed onto many birds at one time. Another advantage of using these types of vaccinations is that vaccinated birds can be distinguished from infected birds. ‚ÄúIt is very important to be able to tell the difference between a bird with a natural infection of avian influenza and a bird that has been vaccinated with the virus,‚Äù says Swayne. ‚ÄúThis differentiation assures international traders that the poultry is not infected with the virus, but rather protected against it.‚Äù‚ÄîBy Sharon Durham, ARS.

The viruses that cause these diseases can be killed by heat. But the exact parameters for inactivating them by pasteurization had not been established‚Äîuntil now. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists have shown that the same industry-standard pasteurization temperatures and times established for Salmonella inactivation in egg products can also kill AI and ND viruses. Pasteurization is a short-term, low-heat process used to kill bacteria in milk, egg products, and other food items without changing the cooking properties or flavor of the food. David Swayne, laboratory director of the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, found that AI and ND viruses could be destroyed by pasteurization. He determined that heat inactivation occurred from 55 ÃäC to 63 ÃäC. The time needed to inactivate the viruses depended on virus strain and egg product. ‚ÄúWhile there are studies indicating that these viruses can be transmitted to birds by ingestion, there are no definitive results showing the same is true for humans. But inactivating the viruses in egg products will preclude possible transmission to humans.‚Äù Swayne artificially infected four commercial egg products with two AI viruses (one with low pathogenicity and one with high pathogenicity) and three ND viruses (two with low virulence and one with high virulence). He then subjected the products to standard, recommended pasteurization temperatures and times and found them to be effective at killing the viruses. ‚ÄúThis study is important because we were able to determine inactivation curves for various temperatures and times for future reference,‚Äù says Swayne. In 2002, more than $322 million of processed egg products were traded internationally. Exporting countries must provide assurances that their products are free from specific infectious agents that could severely affect poultry health. Through this work, ARS has now shown that, with pasteurization, egg products potentially infected with AI and ND viruses can be safely exported and used for food consumption, thereby increasing international trade and improving food safety.‚ÄîBy Sharon Durham, ARS.

('says+say+ads+ad+time+times+likely+like+vaccines+vaccinated+vaccinating+vaccine', 7, 'The Vaccine Crossroads', 'J. Wilson', 'Hundreds of college students each year catch meningococcal disease, an illness that preys particularly on young people in close living conditions. Meningococcal disease is rare, but for those infected, it can be highly dangerous, turning from flu-like symptoms to impaired circulation, failing organs, loss of extremities, and death within 24 hours. About 1 in 10 people with the disease die, and those who survive it may suffer severe complications, such as limb loss and brain damage. Often, however, meningococcal disease never has to happen: A $75, single-shot vaccine protects against four of the five serotypes of meningococcal bacteria. Why then, with such a simple intervention available, are so few students getting immunized? Its a question that could easily be asked about many vaccines that protect adults from diseases. American adults are 100 times more likely than their children to die of vaccine-preventable illnesses, which, in adults, include influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and hepatitis B. Relatively inexpensive, effective vaccines are available for all of these diseases. There are a lot of missed opportunities. Doctors dont think to ask, and patients dont know they need vaccination, or they fear the side effects, said Richard K. Zimmerman, MD, MPH, a family practitioner at the University of Pittsburgh and chair of the adult working group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which publishes an annual list of recommended adult immunizations. But the situation may be changing. A range of factors is bringing vaccines to the forefront of public health and politics for the first time in decades. In particular, fear of bioterrorism has caused people to consider the possibility of vaccination against smallpox and anthrax. During the past few years, the nation has faced unprecedented vaccine shortagesincluding routine pediatric vaccines such as measlesmumpsrubella (MMR) and diphtheriatetanuspertussis (DTaP) vaccines, varicella and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, and adult tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) vaccinesbecause the number of major vaccine manufacturers has declined from 37 in the mid-1960s to only 4 today: Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Aventis Pasteur, and Wyeth Ayerst Pharmaceuticals. Together, these companies supply at least 80% of all vaccines worldwide, and almost 100% of vaccines in the United States. At the same time, technology and research advances have uncovered exciting new roles for vaccines in treating cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases. Its almost a surreal environment where from a science and medicine and technology point of view, nothing could be better, but from a funding and political point of view, nothing could be worse. The current situation with vaccines is really a tangled web of promise and problems thats going to take some real leadership and cooperation between government and private industry, said Gregory A. Poland, MD, the director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic and a past member of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC). Poland and other experts in the field hope to find a solution to the urgent problems while at the same time stimulate interest in vaccines. In January 2003, NVAC issued a report addressing the major barriers to vaccine manufacture and development. To solve these problems, it called for 1) incentives for manufacturers to maintain vaccines and develop new ones, 2) a streamlined regulatory process, and 3) a strengthened injury compensation program. It also suggested government funding of stockpiles of routine vaccines and a public awareness campaign to address supply and safety issues. National Security Threat The NVAC report couldnt have come at a more important time. The looming bioterrorism threat has turned the national crisis over vaccine supply into a high-priority security concern. Weve gotten to a point where this becomes a national security issue, Poland said. When the government wanted to stockpile smallpox vaccine in 2001, for example, it struggled at first to find a company willing to take on the expense and difficulties involved in production. (Manufacturing of the smallpox vaccine ended in the 1970s along with routine vaccination against the disease.) Later, when the government guaranteed payment for more than 100 million doses, it received numerous bids, including three from the major vaccine producers, and contracted Acambis, a biotech company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which had previously focused on developing new vaccines. While Acambis scrambled to assemble a manufacturing plant and fulfill its contract, the government was left hoping that the vaccine wouldnt be needed before it was ready. Similarly, the 2001 anthrax attacks found the country with a shortage of the anthrax vaccine. No company but Bioport, a manufacturer based in Lansing, Michigan, had made the vaccine, and Bioport stopped making it in the late 1990s after repeatedly failing to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) manufacturing requirements. When the government wanted to stockpile the vaccine, it had to wait almost a year before Bioport gained approval to resume production. For other potential bioterrorism agents, such as Ebola virus, Yersinia pestis (plague), and Clostridium botulinum (botulism), no licensed vaccine even exists. It can be a little scary when you look at all of the potential diseases that we dont currently vaccinate anyone against, said Wayne F. Pisano, the executive vice president for commercial operations at Aventis Pasteur, which specializes in the research, development, and manufacture of vaccine. President Bush has called for additional funding for bioterrorism-related vaccine development. Yet pharmaceutical companies remain hesitant about devoting too many resources to these vaccines without a promise that the government will purchase them. Even if the government guaranteed that it would stockpile them for emergency use, developing a new vaccine for a one-time sale is cost prohibitive, according to Pisano. With research and development budget limitations, the return on investment is just too low, he said. He added that while the price of vaccines has increased in recent years, routine child vaccines typically sell at or near the manufacturing cost. The government often pays less than $10 per vaccine dose, while the private sector pays about double that amount, according to a report from the World Health Organization. (The government purchases 56% of all child vaccines and then distributes them in the private sector as needed.) In the future, however, companies may be able to demand more for new vaccines. Some health care companies are paying Wyeth Ayerst more than $200 for the four-dose series of Prevnar, a pneumococcal disease vaccine licensed in 2000. Pharmaceutical companies also see profit potential in charging high prices for new adult vaccines. But generally, even with sales growing by about 7% annually, the entire vaccine market remains relatively unpopular because the pharmaceutical companies can make more money on drugs used over the long term than they can on vaccines that are usually needed only once or a few times in a persons lifetime. Annual vaccine sales total about $5 billion worldwide compared with $300 billion in total drug sales. The Big Concern: Cost The rising cost of producing vaccines has added to their unpopularity. In particular, the cost of manufacturing vaccines has increased dramatically since the FDA began overseeing their regulation in the 1970s and good manufacturing practices became standard. New vaccines cost about half a billion dollars to develop, which is at least equivalent to the cost to develop a new drug, pharmaceutical sources say. Vaccines are also harder to reproduce than most drugs because the manufacturing process uses viruses and bacteria, which are not as stable or reproducible as pharmaceutical agents. This results in higher manufacturing costs and wastage.

The meningococcal outbreak at the Nonsan Recruit Training Center in April 2011 raised public awareness of the need for a meningococcal vaccination for the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA). Although the outbreak of 2011 became a huge social concern promoted by mass media, patients were consistently diagnosed with meningococcal diseases in the ROKA for a long time. Serving as a medical officer at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital, I experienced 12 cases of meningococcal meningitis or septicemia from August 2000 to July 2001 and two of them died within 12 hours after admission [2]. Meningococcal disease is the most frightening infectious disease I have ever experienced. \n \nInvasive meningococcal disease is one of the most severe vaccine-preventable diseases [3]. The effectiveness of primary prevention through vaccination is clearly illustrated by the successful introduction of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine in Europe. Following the introduction of the conjugate vaccine in the UK, there was a 93% reduction in serogroup C disease [4] and 81% reduction in carriage which was considered consistent with herd immunity [5]. \n \nAge groups at high risk for developing meningococcal diseases are infants, adolescents, and young adults. Moreover, military recruits are at the highest risk, due to numerous risk factors they encounter, such as age, diverse geographic background, and crowded living conditions [6]. In the US Army, beginning in October 1971, all new recruits were vaccinated with the serogroup C vaccine, and by Fall 1982, all recruits received quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccines [6]. However, in the ROKA, the vaccination of recruits has only commenced starting in November 2012 [1]. \n \nGenerally, a preventive strategy is instituted for two reasons. First, preventive tactics can be usefully employed against certain diseases with extremely high incidence, despite their low morbidity and mortality. For instance, the incidence of Plasmodium vivax malaria cases exhibited an exponential growth since its re-emergence in 1993 until 2000 (4,142 cases) along the demilitarized zone. The ROKA instituted the mass chemoprophylaxis program in 1997 and not a single mortality case has been reported since. The program was expanded annually from approximately 16,000 soldiers in 1997 to more than 140,000 soldiers in 2002 [7]. The second indication for the use of a preventive strategy is when the course of the disease is expected to be fatal, regardless of its low incidence. Hence, meningococcal diseases and Hantaan virus infection (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) are good examples of such. \n \nThe vaccination against Hantaan virus (Hantavax¬Æ, Green Cross, Seoul, Korea) has kept being implemented for a long time, even until this moment. However, why did the ROKA introduce the meningococcal vaccine so late? To my knowledge, the most plausible cause is due to economic concerns. Menveo¬Æ was auctioned off at 44,066 Korean won (KRW) a dose [8]. For the necessary 300,000 annual doses, it would have cost the ROK about 13 billion KRW. Is this annual cost really too expensive for just two cases of death by a meningococcal disease? There was a similar debate for college freshmen living in dormitories throughout the late 1990s in the US. On one hand, authorities insisted that vaccination of college students is unlikely to be cost-effective [6, 9], but on the other hand, they also acknowledged that it is not just an issue of cost-effectiveness [10]. A cost analysis suggests that, from a societal perspective, vaccination of college students is not likely to be cost-effective. However, it does not take into account the personal tragedy of families that experience the loss of children; the consequences of severe sequelae, such as loss of a limb, neurologic disabilities, and hearing loss; public anxiety; and disruption of social life after the occurrence of one or more cases of severe meningococcal diseases [10]. College freshmen are similarly exposed to the risk factors seen in military recruits for meningococcal diseases [6]. The annual incidence in the ROKA was estimated as nearly the same as that of the dormitory residents of US colleges [2]. Still, do you think the price is too high for your son? I have two sons and they will be conscripted into the Army within several years. I cannot put a price on my sons. \n \nSome physicians have made a counterargument against the introduction of the meningococcal vaccination in the ROKA because they insist that vaccinations against hepatitis A and influenza viruses are much more urgent than that of meningococcal vaccinations [11]. Here are some reasons why I cannot agree with these physicians. All recruits that were conscripted into the ROKA from November to March of every year have already received the influenza vaccination [12]. In addition, hepatitis A is the most prevalent among all young adults, even in those who are not serving as military recruits. Therefore, a different preventive strategy for hepatitis A should be employed from that of meningococcal diseases. In terms of the public heath, hepatitis A vaccination should be included in the National Mandatory Immunization Program. \n \nAbout twelve years ago, I had to let go of four dead soldiers who suffered from meningococcal diseases, including two previously reported deaths [2]. I was deeply saddened and frustrated to lose them before any action could be taken. At that time, I promised them and myself that I would do my best to introduce the meningococcal vaccination to the ROKA. Twelve years later, I now stand behind my own promise for those four young spirits. With my sincere condolences, I would like to say to my soldiers, \"Seo, Park, Cho, and Kim, please rest in peace\".', '2013', 8, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=says+say+ads+ad+time+times+likely+like+vaccines+vaccinated+vaccinating+vaccine&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 22);

Ferry', 'Scientists from Oxford have taken another step along the frustrating route to an effective malaria vaccine. This autumn, Vasee Moorthy of Oxford Universitys Department of Clinical Medicine, working with scientists at the Medical Research Councils Laboratories in the Gambia, began trials of new DNA-based vaccines against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The vaccines, developed by Adrian Hill and colleagues in the same department, have been in phase I trials of safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers in Britain since August 1999. But this is the first time vaccines of this type have been tested in Africa, where malaria kills a million people, mostly children, every year.The first trials in the Gambia, like the Oxford trial, are funded by the Wellcome Trust and will look at the safety of the new vaccines and the size of the immune response they evoke in healthy adult men. ‚ÄúMost people who grow up in an endemic area develop substantial natural immunity,‚Äù says Hill, ‚Äúbut it takes too long to protect young children. If we could convert the immune system of a one-year-old into the immune system of a ten-year-old, we could very substantially reduce malaria mortality.‚ÄùParasitic diseases present particular problems for vaccine development. Plasmodium falciparum is a complex organism with a multi-stage life cycle spent partly in the guts and salivary glands of mosquitoes and partly in the liver and blood of human beings. At each stage of its life cycle it expresses different proteins, allowing it to play ‚Äònow you see me, now you dont‚Äô with the human immune system. Since the 1980s vaccines have been developed in laboratories all over the world, based on 30 or more likely-looking proteins, but so far none has evoked a strong enough immune response to form the basis of a malaria prevention programme.Even if it is only partially effective, it could save many livesThe Oxford vaccine differs from previous candidates in a number of ways. First, Hill and his colleagues realised that they needed to target the most effective component of the immune response. In malaria, that turned out to be not the antibody response, the target of vaccines against many other diseases, but the cell-mediated response. While antibodies neutralise foreign antigens by binding to them, cytotoxic T cells, or killer cells, are also produced during infections to seek and destroy infected cells. To stimulate the cell-mediated response, Hill decided to use a DNA vaccine rather than the more conventional protein or peptide products. Injected DNA ‚Äî the exact sequence chosen to correspond to an antigen that looks like a promising candidate ‚Äî enters the cells of the host and makes the proteins that will trigger the immune response.Finally, the team used a novel belt-and-braces approach called heterologous prime-boost immunisation. This involves injecting the same antigen in two different forms of vaccine one after another ‚Äî an approach Hill originally tried in some desperation when none of the individual vaccines under test in his lab worked well enough on its own. The result was spectacular, providing mice with a high level of protection against the malaria parasite. ‚ÄúThat looked so attractive a few years ago, not only in malaria but in other areas such as HIV, that we thought it was important to see if it worked in people as well,‚Äù says Hill.The two vaccines both contain the complete gene sequence that codes for a parasite surface protein called TRAP (thrombospondin-related adhesion protein, or anonymous protein), one of the family of proteins that enables the parasite to stick to human cells before invading them. It is expressed both during the sporozoite stage of the parasites life cycle, the form that infected mosquitoes inject into humans with each bite, and early in the subsequent liver stage. The vaccine also contains several fragments of five other antigens expressed by liver-stage parasites. Hills team identified these short peptide epitopes as the targets of cytotoxic T cells found in the blood of Africans immune to malaria.When the parasites first arrive in the liver and enter its cells they are relatively few in number, and the victim has yet to show symptoms of illness. Once they have taken up residence in the cells, they divide rapidly before bursting out into the bloodstream in huge numbers. Hills goal is to produce a vaccine that will stimulate cytotoxic T cells to destroy all the infected cells in the liver before the parasite has a chance to multiply.As well as the DNA vaccine, injected into the muscle, the second component of the ‚Äòprime-boost‚Äô strategy is a recombinant viral vaccine called modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), engineered to include DNA sequences for the malaria epitopes and TRAP, and injected into the skin. This non-replicating virus, which has never been used in recombinant form before, was safely used two decades ago in a smallpox immunisation programme. The trials in the UK over the past year have tested each vaccine separately. Both proved safe, and both evoked an immune response. Trials of the two vaccines in combination are still under way. ‚ÄúWe were sufficiently encouraged to go ahead in the Gambia,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúIt will be interesting to compare the strength of the response in people who have never been infected and in people whose immune systems have seen the parasite before.‚Äù By the end of the year, Moorthy hopes to have tested each vaccine separately as well as the two in combination in a small group of volunteers.The next step will be to test the efficacy of the vaccine against the parasite itself. ‚ÄúIf all goes well, we plan to vaccinate another group of volunteers in the UK and challenge them with malaria sporozoites, using a drug-sensitive strain of malaria,‚Äù says Hill. While this approach may sound risky, it has already been successfully used with a very different candidate vaccine known as RTS,S, developed by SmithKline Beecham Biologicals together with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the US and others. The RTS,S vaccine is a protein-based vaccine used with a novel immunostimulatory adjuvant, and has now moved on to field trials, also in the Gambia. RTS,S protected the majority of vaccinated volunteers, but this protection appears to last for months rather than years. The vaccines developers now plan to test prime-boost strategies with RTS,S to see if that can improve its performance.Before they embark on large-scale vaccination programmes, those in charge of public health in countries where malaria is endemic will want to see evidence that vaccines protect a substantial proportion of the vulnerable population, that they are long-lasting, and that they do not themselves cause illness. But even if the DNA vaccine ‚Äúis only partially effective, it could save many lives,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúAnd it should be easier to boost immunity that is already present than to try to create it from scratch.‚Äù', '2000', 3, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=says+say+ads+ad+time+times+likely+like+vaccines+vaccinated+vaccinating+vaccine&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 22),

Gender discrimination is not about political affiliation. It‚Äôs an issue of ignorance that continues to plague our workplaces. It‚Äôs a reality that isn‚Äôt changing anytime soon if we continue to sit still and allow a billionaire television star to decide the future of the working class. \nIt‚Äôs obvious that something needs to change. But in this environment, it‚Äôs impossible to speak up without repercussions. We risk our jobs, our relationships, our livelihoods. It‚Äôs a paradox: the ones who have never been affected by the issue are somehow at the front of the movement, and the women experiencing daily discrimination don‚Äôt feel empowered to speak up. Our society is full of empty voices from celebrity ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù and silenced cries of the oppressed. \n____________________________________________________________ \nThe history of the gender pay gap dates far back to the introduction of women to the workspace. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was the first federal declaration stating that women and men must be paid equally by employers for positions that require the same level of expertise and responsibility. Back then, women earned 59 cents to the dollar. \nIt seems like we‚Äôve come so far since 1963. With ever-increasing awareness of female empowerment and the #MeToo Movement, we‚Äôd think that gender discrimination is simply an issue of the past. But while we‚Äôre making kitchen-cleaning robots and finding new ways to heat up our frozen pizzas, we‚Äôre still failing to realize the ongoing oppression of women. \nIn 2018, women earned 85 cents to the dollar. It took us 55 years to earn an extra 26 cents on our salaries. We celebrate these milestones as we gradually narrow the wage gap, but our slow ‚Äúprogress‚Äù begs the question: How far have we really come? \n____________________________________________________________ \nOn April 4, 2017, Ivanka Trump tweeted out the hashtag #EqualPayDay with a link to an article claiming that the gender pay gap could disappear by the year 2143. In 2017, that was 126 years into the future; today, that‚Äôs 124 years into the future‚Äî124 years too many. If our government stays the way it is, it‚Äôll be impossible for me to see a day when I can bring home the same paycheck as my male counterparts. It‚Äôs ridiculous that politicians even celebrate Equal Pay Day, a ‚Äúholiday‚Äù meant to celebrate and bring awareness to the ‚Äúnarrowing‚Äù wage gap. Would this strange day even exist if we treated women as equals from the beginning? \nTurns out, this supposed act of ‚Äúadvocacy‚Äù was just a pity tweet. That same year, Ivanka Trump made $82 million from various stocks and businesses. The woman ‚Äúadvocating‚Äù for equal pay is the daughter of the man who widened the pay gap in the White House by three times. The woman in the White House has never experienced wage inequality, nor will she ever due to her status. \nI doubt she noticed, but under the headline of the article that Ivanka Trump shared is the caption, ‚ÄúPay gaps are closing for white females, but not at the same rate for women of color.‚Äù The hypocrisy of the situation is very real; the people ‚Äúadvocating‚Äù for our rights are the same ones who refuse to use their political power and influence for good. \n____________________________________________________________ \nThe 2019 U.S. women‚Äôs national soccer team has recently made waves in their fight for gender wage equality, marking a new stepping stone in the global fight. A lawsuit made its way to the U.S. Soccer Federation, eventually winning its battle and securing equal pay for the female players right before the final victory of the World Cup. \nThis story made national headlines as the issue of the gender wage gap resurfaced, becoming a major topic of conversation once again. With leaders rising up every day to join the race to the White House, we hear new viewpoints almost every day on this issue. Most of them say the same‚Äîthat our system needs to change‚Äîfrom Pete Buttigieg suggesting wage transparency to Kamala Harris‚Äôs plan to require data reports from employers by law. \nStudies even show the benefit of closing the gender wage gap, for both the employer and the employee. The Institute for Women‚Äôs Policy Research found that just by paying women as much as men for the same positions, the poverty rate drops by 50%. It would also bring in an additional annual $513 billion in income to the American economy. The GDP would increase by 5% with more women entering the workplace, and employers would have a larger pool of applicants, bringing in more qualified candidates to take positions. \nAll signs point to yes‚Äîwe need change, we need equality. We‚Äôre not stuck in an age when our most pressing issue is where we‚Äôll find plants to gather while the men go hunting. Women have bills to pay, families to support, and requirements to live‚Äîthe same needs and responsibilities that men have, too. We‚Äôre no different; we‚Äôre human and equal. We can‚Äôt sit still as we listen to celebrities in a world of glamour while we ignore the voices of our neighbors crying out for change. \n____________________________________________________________ \nWhen I asked my mother why she didn‚Äôt speak up about the wage inequality, she simply answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my job.‚Äù She‚Äôs seen all of this before: the discrimination, harassment, and unfair rules that she‚Äôs forced to follow. And yet, each time, she‚Äôs learned that staying quiet is the safest option. \nIt‚Äôs a terrifying reality for women around the globe: the ultimate decision between justice and losing everything. It‚Äôs a decision that we shouldn‚Äôt have to make, one that future generations should never have to even contemplate. The answer is simple: bring justice for women by treating us like the individuals we are. The only thing we can do is continue to speak out until our voices begin to spark progress‚Äîand fast. \nKeywords: gender, wage, inequality, pay gap, work \nImage Source: Wikimedia Commons \n____________________________________________________________ \n* Amy Kim is a student at McIntosh High School in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Politics of Knowledge in Premodern Islam: Negotiating Ideology and Religious Identity. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2006. Pp. 292. ISBN 0-8078-2993-5 (cloth); 0-8078- 5657-6 (pbk.). This intensely personal narrative is a modern argument about an ancient question: how is a moral individual to conduct himself in an immoral environment? In a remarkable introduction, the author (born in 1970 in the United States) informs us that this project arose because of \"questions of religious ideology\" that led his family to return to the US from Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution, only to be confronted by a similar, ongoing, inquisition in post-9/11 America. In America, he turned to Persian mystic poets, in the hope that they would help him \"recover the fluid religiosity of my childhood. Like many other expatriate Iranians, I sought to-and perhaps needed to-identify a de-politicized (and preferably de-historicized) realm of spiritual poetry out of which I could resurrect a worldview that was at once spiritual and rational, tolerant and modern\" (pp. xxi-xxii). Safi writes that he found this fluid religiosity in \"an oppositional sufi\" Ayn al-Qudat Abu l-Maali Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Hasan al-Mayanji al-Hamadani (492-525/1098-1131), who possessed \"all the qualifications of being a powerful insider,\" being \"a judge, a sufi [sufi], a popular preacher, etc.,\" but used his position \"not to bargain with the Saljuqs but to rise against them, defiantly contesting their legitimacy\" (p. 158) and was executed for it at the age of thirty three in Isfahan. \"He was for me Rumi [Jalal al-Din Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Rumi (d. 672/1273)] and Ibn Arabi [Muhyi l-Din Muhammad b. Ali (d. 638/1240)], poet and social critic, lover and philosopher, all wrapped up in one.\" The book, originally a doctoral dissertation, represents the authors attempt \"to figure out something about why he was killed.\" The answer, an erudite, intellectually disciplined account of a journey of the soul, is presented in six chapters. The first three set out the methodological framework, as becomes a dissertation; the last three examine three stylised responses: capitulation, negotiation, or opposition. With some simplification of the authors complex and nuanced account the storyline may be sketched as follows. The Saljuqs were nominal Muslims, who contested and negotiated with the Caliph, and-through the vezir- coerced all (especially, notable scholars and mystics), in their quest for power. This is exemplified in the life of Nizam al-Mulk (408-485/1018-1092) whose complex negotiations on politics and \"ideology\" were the proximate determinants of the substance of religious orthodoxy and sufi lore of the times. In addition to personal influence, the \"state apparatus\" of surveillance, land-grants, madrasahs and khanqahs was employed to ensure compliance. How did individuals respond to this environment? Abau Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali (450-505/1058-1111) accepted the patronage of Nizam al-Mulk; contrary to accounts of his \"allegedly spiritual quest\" (p. 204) al- Ghazali \"was, and remained forever, a political creature\" (p. 109), not above using \"the ultimate trump card, the Quran\" (p. 120) to legitimize obedience to the Saljuqs. Less closely linked to power than the madrasah ulama, some sufis-Baba Tahir (Uryan, dates uncertain), Abau Said Abi l-Khayr (d. 440/1049), and Shaykh Ahmad ibn Abau l-Hasan Ahmad-i Jam, Zindahfil (d. 536/1141)-employed \"spiritual blackmail\" (p. 129) by asking for support for sufis and khanqahs, in return for enhancing legitimacy by their blessings, \"supportive\" visions, and wondrous deeds (karamat). Finally, there is the \"oppositional\"-the posture approved by fellow-emigre, Edward Said-sufi, Ayn al-Qudat al-Hamadani, a student of Abau Hamid al-Ghazalis works and his brothers (Abau l-Futauh Ahmad al-Ghazali, d. 520/1126) disciple, who was executed for his refusal to legitimize the Saljuqs and his opposition to their ideology. ‚Ä¶', '2008', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+posts+ivanka+families+carolina&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 23),

DaÃßbrowski, Hanna Klimek', 'Abstract To analyse the competitiveness of container ports, it is crucially important to identify and characterize the key factors of competitiveness. Their relative importance depends on the location of the port, the situation in the market and it can be perceived differently by different groups of stakeholders. The aim of this study was to examine factors of global competitiveness of container ports as perceived by shipping lines. The research method applied was a quantitative primary non-random social sampling. Data were collected from survey participants via a business-oriented social network. Two statistical methods were used to rank and group these factors: a Friedman test and a post-hoc analysis involving Least Significant Difference test (LSD). Shipping executives (n¬†=¬†120) stressed the importance of three factors: container terminal service quality, social harmony with labour and adequate nautical accessibility. This corresponds with growing size of container ships, which require deep water container terminals and reliable port services. Shipping lines decision makers need services of a high standard and with a low risk of labour-related disruptions to maintain their own high level of service quality. These strong views are held by decision makers of shipping lines with over 250 employees, while smaller organisations are more lenient on container terminal requirements. Survey results were also presented per continent, which clarifies any differences in importance of competitiveness factors based on geographical location. This may be useful for competitiveness gap analysis at a more granular level. Port operators and regulators should take these findings into account and address them in ports‚Äô strategic plans.', '2020', 11, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ship+ships+shipping+sep+ports+port+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 25),

Gourlay', 'In this paper, selected results are presented from a set of recent full-scale trials measuring dynamic sinkage, trim and heel of sixteen container ship transits entering and leaving the Port of Fremantle , Western Australia. Measurements were made using high-accuracy GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers and a fixed reference station. Measured dynamic sinkage, trim and heel of three example container ship transits are discussed in detail. Maximum dynamic sinkage and dynamic draught, as well as elevations of the ship‚Äôs keel relative to Chart Datum, are calculated. A theoretical method using slender-body shallow-water theory is applied to calculate sinkage and trim for the transits. It is shown that the theory is able to predict ship squat (steady sinkage and trim) with reasonable accuracy for container ships at full-scale in open dredged channels. In future work, the measured ship motions, along with full measured wave time-series data, will be used for validating wave-induced motions software. Author keywords: Squat; Ship UKC; Approach channel; Shallow water; Container ships. Introduction Since the 1990s, full-scale measurements on dynamic ship motions in waterways have been successfully carried out with the increasing accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (Feng and OMahony 1999; H√§rting and Reinking 2002; Gourlay and Klaka 2007; Ha et al. 2016). These trials have played important roles in furnishing accurate and reliable full-scale data that may be utilized by ports, pilots and deck officers. Model-scale tests, being in a controlled environment, remain the method of choice for benchmarking studies (Mucha et al. 2014; Gourlay et al. 2015b), with appropriate allowance for scale effects (Graff et al. 1964; Deng et al. 2014). Conducting full-scale trials involves a great deal of time and requires thorough preparation and close collaboration with pilots, port terminals, shipping agents and port VTS (Vessel Traffic Service). Care must be taken not to interfere with port operations, nor delay the normal pilotage . In addition, with regard to validation of numerical ship motion modelling at full-scale, there are uncertainties in applying theoretical methods to actual transit conditions, such as: seabed conditions; varying bathymetry; ever-changing waves, wind and currents; and commercial ships whose lines plans are confidential. Despite the difficulties in implementation and application, measurements and validations at full-scale provide an important practical test of numerical UnderKeel Clearance (UKC) modelling. In April 2016, at the Port of Fremantle, Western Australias largest general cargo port, the authors performed full-scale trials on 16 container ship transits, including 7 inbound and 9 outbound transits, via the Deep Water Channel, Entrance Channel and Inner Harbour (see chart AUS112 and 113). The purpose of the trials is not only to obtain high-quality data on vertical ship motions in the port approach channels including squat and wave-induced motions, but also to validate current UKC practice using the data from the measurements. Here, dynamic sinkage, trim and heel of three example container ships over their entire transits can be calculated by comparing the vertical motions when underway to the stationary condition at the berth. The dynamic draught and UKC at each point on the ship in the approach channels are also calculated. The net UKC and risk of running aground are then governed by the maximum dynamic draught over all of the most vulnerable hull extremities, i.e. the Forward Perpendicular (FP), Aft Perpendicular (AP), and port and starboard bilge corners (Gourlay 2007). Such data accumulation of the full-scale measurements will be of importance to comprehensive guidelines for minimum UKC. Details of ship motion trials Measurements were made on 16 container ship transits in total using the shore-based receiver method, which uses high-accuracy GNSS receivers onboard as well as a fixed base station for an external reference. Raw data from the trials has been published as a CMST (Centre for Marine Science and Technology) report (Ha and Gourlay 2016). The general process of full-scale trials and the shore-based receiver method are described in Gourlay and Klaka (2007) and Ha et al. (2016). Data recording covers a period of time before departure or after arrival to take a stationary reading at the berth. In the present trials, data recording was commenced prior to leaving the berth for the outbound transits and continued until after all mooring work had been completed for the inbound transits. The at-berth measurements were then used as a reference value for comparing the vertical height measurements while underway. Description of the ships and transit conditions The following criteria have been taken into account in choosing example transits for further analysis: ÔÇ∑ A transit should have no suspicious data or ambiguity problems in any measurement results, and hence should be considered as a set of high-quality data ÔÇ∑ Hydrostatic data at an actual transit draught should have been obtained during trials to assist with ship motion validation. This data is obtained from the ship‚Äôs Trim and Stability Book ÔÇ∑ For validating ship motion predictions, there should be a published representative ship model that has similar characteristics to the actual ship. Ships should be fairly modern, so that analysis can keep pace with contemporary trends in ship design ÔÇ∑ Relevant environmental data such as waves, wind and tides should be obtained On this basis, three transits have been chosen for analysis: SEAMAX STAMFORD, built in 2015, a Post-Panamax container ship with a capacity of 4,896 TEU; MOL PARAMOUNT, built in 2005, a Post-Panamax container ship with a capacity of 6,350 TEU; and CMA CGM WAGNER, built in 2004, a Post-Panamax container ship with a capacity of 5,782 TEU. Details of these ships are shown in Table 1. Displacement and block coefficient (CB) are values at summer draught. Block coefficient (CB) is the ratio of displaced volume to (LPP.Beam.Draught). MOL PARAMOUNT and CMA CGM WAGNER have similar ship dimensions, and they have slightly lower CB than SEAMAX STAMFORD. Table 1.

Galal', 'Over the past few decades, the rapid expansion of trade has led to a tremendous increase in cargo handling between the various continents. This continuous growth has motivated shipping lines to increase the ships sizes which may lead to the need to develop many of container terminals. Generally, the complete demolition of an existing quay wall construction and replacing by a new structure is often not possible due to the high costs. The deepening and upgrading of the existing quay walls is the next option. This means that the existing quay walls will have to retain more soil than they actually designed for. The general approach for this case is to review the original design and subsequent improvement calculations. The present study was carried out to evaluate numerically, using the numerical model PLAXIS 2D, the possibility to upgrade the existing open-piled quay wall structure of the container terminal of Port Said West port, Egypt. A rehabilitation technique consisting of new fender piles and new box sheet pile panels had been selected to accommodate the berth deepening and the heavier new container crane loads. The evaluation had been carried out through the review of the original design and subsequent improvement analyses under the development two cases defined as Pre- and Post-upgrading cases. The results showed that the structure after upgrading was able to keep the stability of the soil to its previous levels before upgrading and quay wall structure elements were able to resist the deepening effect plus the increase in crane loads.', '2017', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ship+ships+shipping+sep+ports+port+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 25),

The bottom-up approach is becoming increasingly popular because it can estimate ship fuel consumption by accounting for ship activity conditions, such as changes in voyage speed, time, and distance; however, its use is still limited when estimating ship fuel consumption. Ship-specific information, such as the daily fuel consumption rate for main and auxiliary engines for every vessel, is expensive to gather, and generally not collected from private shipping companies. To address this research gap, we develop simplified and composite ship fuel consumption models for ocean-going container ships by size using a regression model. To estimate the fuel consumption models for container ships, we rely on ship activity data, including average speed and sailing time, distance, and actual fuel consumption for main and auxiliary engines. This information is obtained from a major container shipping company in Korea. We estimate and validate the parameters associated with fuel consumption for five different container ship sizes, all of which are smaller than the Post-Panamax container ship (15,000 TEU and above).', '2019', 10, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ship+ships+shipping+sep+ports+port+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 25),

Rupnik, J. Prezelj', '\n Identification of noise sources and their ranking is a crucial part of any noise abatement program. This is a particularly difficult task when a complex source, such as a seaport, is considered. COVID -19 epidemic has had a significant impact on environmental noise related to road, rail, air and ship traffic and provided a unique opportunity to observe immediate noise reduction. In order to identify the noise sources, whose reduction was most effective in reducing noise from the port area, this study compared and quantified noise emissions between the historical and epidemic periods. Environmental noise measurements from three noise monitoring stations at the port boundary were analysed. In addition, noise emissions from ship, road, rail and industry as well as meteorological data in the historical pre ‚Äì COVID -19 (January 2018 - February 2020) and COVID-19 (April 2020) period were analysed in detail. The characteristics of the noise sources mentioned, geographical data and noise measurements were used to develop and validate a noise model of the port area, which was used to calculate noise contour maps. Our results show that the reduction in noise levels observed at all monitoring stations coincides with the reduced shipping traffic. The A weighted equivalent sound pressure levels in the day, evening and night periods were reduced by 2.2 dB to 5.7 dB compared to the long-term averages, and the area of the 55 dB day-evening-night noise contour was reduced by 23 %. Compared to the historical period, the number of people exposed to noise levels above 55 dB(A) in the day-evening-night period due to shipping and industrial activities was reduced by 20% in the COVID -19 period. Such results show that environmental noise generated by moored ships is a problem for port cities that should be regulated internationally. In addition, this paper provides precise guidance on noise emission characteristics, ship categorisation and the post-processing of long-term measurement data, taking into account wind conditions and undesired sound events, which can be applied to future research at other locations near shipping ports and used to prepare strategies for noise reduction in ports.\n', '2020', 10, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+ship+ships+shipping+sep+ports+port+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 25),

Wani', 'The changing lifestyle with rapid industrialization has made the requirement of electricity as essential and important over the years. During the last few decades increasing price of electricity and decreasing reserves of fossil fuels has raised concerns for the policy makers, industrialist, investors and the general public. The change in global climate is one of the significant environmental concern which leads to increase in greenhouse gases. The electric power sector is one of the biggest source of greenhouse gas emission. Policy makers across the globe have been looking for sustainable and feasible input energy source for electricity generation. The use of renewable energy as an alternative source of energy to conventional sources of energy is considered as the most effective policy across the power sector in the world. Various options of renewable energy are available such as solar, wind, biomass, hydro, geothermal, tidal and so forth for electricity generation. Among all the sources solar energy is the cleanest and greenest form of renewable energy. Sun rays are available in abundance in India. Generation of electricity from solar energy is absolutely pollution free and it saves the conventional forms of electricity. There is no burning of fossil fuels or emission of hazardous gases. Tapping of solar energy is absolutely free but in reality it involves high installation cost and understanding of the complete technology. So the people are not motivated to generate electricity with the help of solar photovoltaic cells. They are unaware of the benefits and technology of solar energy. Gujarat is one of the leading states in India to promote renewable sources of energy. This study mainly focuses on awareness and perception of people towards the promotional strategies for solar applications in Gujarat State. It includes the study of promotional policies for solar energy in Gujarat State and also focuses on whether people are aware about these policies. This study also covers the awareness of people for using solar energy applications and the perception of the people towards solar applications, its benefits and promotional strategies of government towards solar adoption of solar energy for electricity generation. The responses are taken from both users and non-users of solar applications in the State of Gujarat only. The objectives of the research are: 1. Study of Promotional policies for Solar Energy in Gujarat state. 2. Study of awareness among citizens of Gujarat for applications of Solar Energy 3. Study of difficulties faced by citizens of Gujarat for installing the solar energy system for generation of electricity. 4. Study of perception of the general public regarding the schemes announced by Gujarat Government for applications of solar energy. Chapter wise summarisation of the research study is given as: Chapter 1 depicts the introduction relating to the research conducted. It explains the solar initiatives taken by GOI (Government of India) for the promotion of solar. Gujarat is the first state to introduce solar policy in India. Objectives of Gujarat solar policy is introduced in this chapter. Several promotional measures taken by GOI is briefed such as 1) Institutes and agencies developed for promoting renewable energy 2) Renewable purchase obligation (RPO) 3) Renewable Energy Certificate 4) Rooftop SPV scheme, 5) Solar parks 6) Canal banks and roof tops. 7) Loans and subsidies 8) Workshops, seminars and training programmes. It also reveals the barriers which restricts the adoption of solar applications by the general public. The importance of the study is explained briefly. Chapter 2 deals with industry overview of solar. History and Development of solar technology since the early centuries from 7 century B.C. till today is briefed in this chapter. Development and promotion of solar in India through different policies and initiatives taken by MNRE is described in the chapter. Initiatives for renewable energy taken through Five-Year plans by GOI are also explained year-wise. Several policies and acts implemented by GOI are mentioned in this chapter. Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission and several State solar policies are described. Also the current status of solar and its development in India is discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3 is of review of literature. It is the review of the work of researchers across the globe and in India regarding awareness, perception and barriers towards adoption of solar technology. Also the papers relating to recent trends in solar in India as well as abroad are reviewed. Chapter 4 relates with the research methodology adopted for the research. Descriptive research design is adopted for this study. Non-probability convenience type of sampling technique is used. For the study the people of India specifically of Gujarat State are considered as population. Sampling unit are the individuals of Gujarat State both users and nonusers of solar energy applications. Sample size is of 754 respondents from five major cities of Gujarat state Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Jamnagar. Both Primary and secondary data was collected for the study. Primary data was collected with the help of structured questionnaire. Secondary data was collected from different sources such as various government websites, journals, books, magazines, research thesis, internet, newspapers and unpublished work of certain authors. Chapter 5 comprises of Data analysis and interpretation. Data analysis is done with the help of three techniques such as: Univariate analysis: Involvement of single variable for measurement at a time. It includes frequency distribution, bar charts, pie charts showing percentages, clustered bar charts and mean score of several factors to know the influence of certain factors among the responses received. Bivariate analysis: Involvement of two variables for measurement at a time. For this study statistical techniques such as cross tabulation, Chi-Square test are used to show the association between two variables. Multivariate analysis: Involvement of three or more than three variables for measurement at a time. For this study the interdependence technique used is Factor analysis. Three factors were extracted for importance of benefits of solar energy and six factors were extracted for reasons for not using solar energy for generation of electricity. Kruskaldistribution. Also One-way ANOVA test was conducted for importance of benefits of solar energy. Cluster Analysis was used to partition a set of objects into two or more groups based on the similarity of the objects for a set of specified characteristics. It was used for both benefits of solar energy and reasons for not using solar for electricity generation. Chapter 6 deals with Findings of the research study. From the analysis it is found that 94.4% of respondents are aware about renewable energy. Most of the people are aware about different applications of solar energy such as solar cookers, water heaters, solar panels etc. Despite of such awareness only 26% are using solar applications. Newspaper and television are the popular media through which people come to know about solar energy applications. From the five-point likert scale used for importance of benefits of solar energy, it was observed that people are environment conscious requiring safe and clean environment. Another five point likert scale was used for reasons for not using solar energy for electricity generation. It was found that people hesitates to use solar energy for electricity generation due to its high capital cost, battery-backup/storage cost and less financial incentives. Also people are less aware of the government solar policies and incentives. This requires a huge awareness and training programmes to be conducted on large scale among the people. From the opinion of the people it was observed that they are ready to adopt solar if more incentives are available from the Government.

The development of cotton began seven thousand years back, in the Indus Valley, a place possessed today by north-western India and eastern Pakistan. Worldwide Cotton Advisory Committee (2010) expressed that the biggest makers of cotton in 2009 were China and India with yearly creation of around 34 million and 24 million bundles individually. The material businesses in these two nations devour up to 80% of what they create. The expanding importance of this harvest is because of its overall convenience particularly in the Textile business, its commitment to total national output (GDP) of different nations, the salary it accommodates people occupied with the generation and advertising of the yield, and the utilizations and potential uses to which its seeds can be put. It is evaluated that United State material factories directly expend about 7.6 million bunches of cotton a year. Joined States Department of Agriculture (2008) found that cotton seed oil positioned fifth underway among vegetable oils in the 2007/08 edit season with somewhat fewer than four of world volumes. Cotton creation has critical effect on sustenance security and enhanced future in rustic territories of creating nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa (Ademji 2007). This is a drive towards submitting the world to annihilate hunger. Cotton creation in Nigeria dated back to 1903 with the British Cotton Growers Association leading the pack until 1974, when it was disbanded and supplanted by the Cotton Marketing Board to create gin and market the items. Following the deregulation of the Nigerian economy in 1986, the Board was eradicated in connection to the economic exercises rendered by it. The Cotton Consultative Committee (CCC) was set up in a warning ability to the legislative division, while a cotton spinning store conspire with an administration Committee (CRFMC) was set up to guarantee the reasonable supply of confirmed cottonseed to ranchers. In 2005, the Cotton Development Committee was built up which included both the CCC and the CRFMC, to address the cotton economy in a powerful and effective way. Cotton showcasing and generation are very mutilated by open arrangement. Cotton is developed as a money trim by numerous family units on an all-out evaluated zone running from 0.6-08 million hectares. The significant highlights of cotton creation in Nigeria particularly in north western district is that around eighty (80%) of all out generation is by worker ranchers under rain bolstered conditions with straightforward instrument and furthermore creature drawn executes (Onu and Atala, 1992; Adeniji, 2002). The development of market and marketing system is also an important part of cotton production as that of increasing productivity also. The trend in modern agriculture is increasing the range of agricultural marketing from the point of view of product marketing with fair compensation in agricultural production, because production and productivity are not only the required requirements for development of cotton. Farmers always inspire to get best price from their produce, but due to deficiency of fair marketing functionaries, market efficiencies, marketing system and marketing channel they are not able to obtain compensative price. Marketing system and its efficiency plays a crucial role in rewarding agricultural production. Dawar (2012) expressed that agriculturists are exceedingly cost responsive. Consequently, a steady cotton value approach holds the key for cotton creation and efficiency. In order to enhance the productivity of the cotton-crops, steps might be taken to limit the expense of generation by augmenting the yield. The effectiveness of essential info, for example, seed, manure and pesticides might be enhanced as to limit the expense through expanded yield. II-LITERATURE REVIEV Nwanosikeet. al. (2016) examined Profitability and Production Efficiency of cotton Production in North West Nigeria. The study found out that very few farmers of only eighteen per cent were registered with a cooperative for an average period of five years. Farm sizes in the study area were small with an average of 1.3 hectares. Approximately ninety eight per cent of these cotton farmers were married with average household size of nine persons per household. And ninety four per cent of the farmers did not have access to credit. Result of average net farm income was ‚Ç¶ 41525 per hectare. Results of the estimated determinants of technical efficiency in cotton production showed that age was positive and significant at ten per cent while cooperative association and extension contact were positive and significant at one per cent level of probability.

Excerpt UVA-F-1899 Feb. 28, 2020 Wilson Family Foundation Janet OBrien had been working in the family office of a central Virginia family-owned business for over five years. Her initial responsibility had been to evaluate proposals that came to the familys charitable foundation, the Wilson Family Foundation (the Foundation), and make recommendations as to which proposals most aligned with the Foundations objectives and, at the same time, seemed most likely to achieve stated goals. By late 2018, however, she was helping others in the office identify investments for the Foundations assets. While most of the Foundations assets were managed by outside professionals, about $ 20million was managed in-house‚Äîtypically invested in equities, government securities, or corporate bonds. The Foundation tended to adjust its holdings infrequently, and typically held investments for at least a year, and often much longer. The investment committee comprised two family members and the foundations executive director. On December 21, 2018, OBrien was scanning headlines and came across a piece in U.S. News and World Report that identified seven corporate-bond investments that professionals believed would make good choices for 2019. Of those seven investments, she was most intrigued by possible investments in the bonds of three companies: Allegiant Travel, GameStop, and Western Union. Having identified specific bonds issued by these companies that the Foundation might wish to hold, her next task was to evaluate each bonds attractiveness and select which, if any, to recommend to the investment committee. . . .', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+news+yearly+year+years+state+stated+price+pricing&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 26),

Ismail', 'Fossil fuels (Natural gas, heavy and light oil) are considered the main sources for electricity generation in Libya. Libya‚Äôs electricity demand is growing at a rapid rate and the country will require significant additional capacity in the coming years due to the development of all sectors of life and the improvement of individuals‚Äô life quality, without taking into account the rationalization of electricity consumption. The main reason for this is that Libya has a very high energy subsidy, especially the tariff set by the Libyan state for the price per kilowatt-hour for electricity sector. The heavily subsidized electricity price for household currently stands at (20 dirham‚Äôs/kilowatt-hour) compared to (100 dirham‚Äôs/kilowatt-hour), as the domestic price of fuel cost, and in return (450 dirham‚Äôs/kilowatt-hour) as the electricity cost of fuel in international prices. In order to reduce the deficit and the ongoing balancing in energy demand with the amount of generation of available capacity it is necessary to study all electrical systems for the future, the most important of which are wind energy and solar energy projects to meet a significant part of this demand, and to reduce, as much as possible, the carbon dioxide emissions. This paper deals with the wind data processing at the site coupled with the city and its relationship to electricity generation. It presents long term wind data analysis, in terms of averages of ten minute values of wind speed were used to get yearly mean values for a period of 1 year, between 04/11/2002 and 30/12/2003. Most frequent wind directions are NW, N, NNW and WNW. They represent about 50%, followed by E, ESE and SE. In general, East and SE winds are relatively frequent but weak at the same time. The most powerful directions are NW, WNW, W and NNW which by far - represent about 46% of the expected power, followed by N. It should be noted that the high frequency of north direction winds that come from the desert can cause a high frequency of dust episodes. This fact should be taken into consideration in order to take appropriate measures to prevent wind turbine deterioration. The annual energy yield and wind direction were evaluated for AL-Magrun town, considering wind turbines ranging between 1.65 MW and 2 MW (power curve considering air density 1.225 kg/m3). The wind turbine (Gamesa 90/2000) recorded the highest values, equaling (6.05GWh,3023Eqh) and (M. Torres TWT 1.65-82 ) equaling (4.39 GWh, 2660 Eqh) compared to the rest of the turbines studied.

Hultman, R. Dubayah, Jennifer Kennedy, G. Hurtt', 'Afforestation and reforestation have the potential to provide effective climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration. Strategic reforestation activities, which account for both carbon sequestration potential (CSP) and economic opportunity, can provide attractive options for policymakers who must manage competing social and environmental goals. In particular, forest carbon pricing can incentivize reforestation on private land, but this may require landholders to forego other profits. Here, we utilize an ambitious geospatial approach to quantify economic opportunities for reforestation in the state of Maryland (USA) based on high-resolution remoting sensing, ecosystem modeling, and economic analysis. Our results identify spatially-explicit areas of economic opportunity where the potential revenue from forest carbon outcompetes the expected profit of existing cropland at the hectare scale. Specifically, we find that under a baseline economic scenario of $20 per ton of carbon (5% rental rate) and decadal average crop profitability, a transition to forest on agricultural land would be more profitable than 23.2% of cropland in Maryland under a 20 year land-use commitment. Accounting for variations in carbon and crop pricing, 5.5%‚Äì55.4% of cropland would be immediately outcompeted by expected forest carbon revenue, with the potential for an additional 0.5%‚Äì10.6% of outcompeted cropland within 20 years. Under the baseline economic scenario, an annual allocation of $5.8 million towards a carbon rental program could protect 6.93 Tg C (3.4% of the state‚Äôs total remaining CSP) on reforested croplands. This moderate yearly cost is equal to 9.7% of Maryland‚Äôs average annual auction proceeds from participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (between 2014 and 2018), and 19.3% of the average annual subsidy payments for corn, soy, and wheat allocated over the same period.

Social distancing and learning to live our lives in a more isolated state is the price we must all pay to stay safe. The news cycle seems to change by the minute, and we cannot be sure when our lives will return to normal. An unfortunate side effect of this mandated isolation is that the list of postponed or canceled SPE events has grown, while estimated financial losses continue to mount throughout the industry. No company or organization could have predicted our industry would be facing a viral pandemic, coupled with oil prices at their lowest levels in almost 2¬†decades.

For those who served on the SPE Board of Directors during 2015 and 2016, it was painful yet necessary to reduce or eliminate programs that we could not financially justify due to the loss in event revenue. SPE events provide approximately 70% of the total income required for our Society to operate. It was also necessary to lower overhead costs by reducing our number of employees. SPE used this reduction in force to reorganize and streamline divisions, which resulted in greater collaboration and regional offices operating more efficiently. When the industry started to correct itself and event revenue returned, the board of directors remained cautious about spending. Their goal was to put SPE in a position to withstand another downturn, both financially and through the member programs we offer. We must be able to deliver on our mission to collect, disseminate, and exchange technical knowledge concerning the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas resources, and related technologies for the public benefit.

Hudspeth', 'Illinois ended 2011 with a better financial situation than it faced a year earlier. However, the state began the year with a hole so deep that not even a massive tax increase and drastic spending cuts could come close to filling it. In this chapter, we use a carefully constructed model of the Illinois budget and detailed database about past revenue and expenditures to develop projections of future fiscal balance. This analysis delivers what is, perhaps, the headline message from our work: We find that maintaining increased income tax rates after they are scheduled to expire and extreme austerity with respect to spending could bring Illinois into fiscal balance by Fiscal Year 2019. We neither endorse nor reject this scenario but believe that it provides a useful baseline against which alternative fiscal plans can be measured. Unfortunately, Illinois‚Äô accounting and budgeting practices have not promoted good fiscal behavior and sometimes obscure the nature and extent of its fiscal challenges. Illinois still has about $4 billion in unpaid General Funds bills, and no financial plan to deal with the backlog. 1 A major tax increase in January 2011 brought increased income tax receipts, but federal aid is down because the national stimulus plan has ended. General Funds spending was capped at 2 percent, but Illinois has more than 600 other funds that have no cap on growth. The state comptroller‚Äôs website reports the deficits in the General Revenue Fund, but no one officially reports deficits in the non-General Funds. The good news is that policy solutions to address a budget gap on the order of $10 billion are potentially available. We estimate that if the large increases in income tax rates adopted in January 2011 are not phased out and if the growth in total state spending can be kept down to the consumer price inflation rate, the budget gap could be eliminated within 10 years.

We go on to study the relationship between stock price reactions to corpo rate news announcements and characteristics of the firms. Operating under th assumption that news announcements have an asymmetrical impact on stock pri e according to factors like firm size, years of being publicly tra ded, or industry classification, we categorize firms by whether their corporate news announcements will be more or less valuable to the public. For example, since the public may know more about larger firms, we expect the market to re act less strongly (in absolute value) to new information from large firms .

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)‚Äôs World Investment Report 2015 indicates that the amount of corporate profits shifted from developing countries is about $450 billion USD, [1] and found that tax avoidance practices result in a significant leakage of development financing resources and an estimated $100 billion USD tax revenue loss per year for developing countries. [2] China, as one of the largest developing countries, also suffers a lot from tax avoidance practices by multi-national enterprises (MNEs). Chinese state media estimates that tax evasion and avoidance by foreign companies costs the worlds second largest economy at least 30 billion Yuan ($4.8 billion USD) in tax revenues each year. [3] In recent years, particularly after G20 conference in Australia in 2013, China has taken transnational tax avoidance issue seriously. In November 2014 China levied about $140 million in back taxes from Microsoft Corp in the first major case concerning cross-border tax evasion in the country. [4] Furthermore, the Chinese government has increased tax scrutiny of foreign companies by the implementation of new rules designed to rein in cross-border tax avoidance, particularly transfer pricing arrangements. This article examines the major forms of intellectual property (IP) related tax avoidance activities conducted by major technology-related MNEs, in particular, China‚Äôs new anti-tax avoidance rules and policies (such as particular transfer pricing regulations). These include the Public Notice Regarding Refining the Reporting of Related-Party Transactions and Administration of Transfer Pricing Documentation (SAT Public Notice [2016] No. 42) ( ‚ÄúPublic Notice 42‚Äù) issued by the State Administration of Taxation (‚ÄúSAT‚Äù) of China, and the SAT‚Äôs submission to the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countrie s (the Manual) in December 2016.This article explores the implications of these new rules and policies to IP related transactions.

Methods: This partially blinded study randomized 6‚Äì12-week-old infants to receive two-dose priming and a booster (at ages 2, 4, 12‚Äì15 months) with: PCV13 at priming and PHiD-CV at boosting (PPS); PCV13 then PHiD-CV at priming and PHiD-CV at boosting (PSS); or PHiD-CV at priming and boosting (SSS control). All analyses were descriptive, i.e., no statistical significance tests were done. Results: The total vaccinated cohort at priming comprised 294 infants. Grade 3 adverse events were reported after 8.7% (PPS), 11.4% (PSS), and 16.9% (SSS) of primary doses (primary objective). No serious adverse events were considered vaccination-related. For most PHiD-CV serotypes, observed percentages of children reaching antibody concentrations ‚â•0.2 ¬µg/mL and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers above cutoffs were similar across groups 1 month post-priming and post-booster. Observed geometric mean antibody concentrations and OPA titers were lower for some PHiD-CV serotypes with the mixed regimens than with PHiD-CV only, especially for PSS. However, no tests of statistical significance were performed. Conclusions: Immunogenicity of the two mixed PCV13/PHiD-CV regimens seemed mostly similar to that of a PHiD-CV-only series, although observed antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs for some PHiD-CV serotypes were lower.

We assessed the immunogenicity of three infant vaccination regimens: 1) priming with two doses of Prevnar 13 and boosting with Synflorix; 2) priming with one dose of Prevnar 13 followed by one dose of Synflorix and boosting with Synflorix; 3) priming and boosting with Synflorix. The study showed that: Switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix at any time during the vaccination regimen did not seem to affect safety. When switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix at the time of boosting, immunogenicity was mostly similar to that of the Synflorix- only regimen. Switching vaccines during priming resulted in a trend toward lower immune responses for some vaccine components. What is the impact? This piece of evidence can be considered by doctors and health authorities when evaluating the possibility of switching pneumococcal vaccines in an immunization program or individual immunization regimen. Further effectiveness studies from countries or regions switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix (or vice versa) may shed more light on the feasibility of switching between these vaccines.', '2020', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=vaccine+vaccinated+vaccination+vaccines+vaccinations+children+said+trials+trial+macklom+mackloms&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 28),

Before the introduction of vaccination, measles caused yearly epidemics putting vulnerable children at risk of brain damage and death. Despite safe and cost-effective vaccines, measles remains a leading cause of death in children globally. Due to insufficient vaccine coverage and low levels of in utero transferred antibodies from vaccinated mothers, outbreaks of measles in Denmark and other high-income countries are observed at increasing frequency. The current vaccine was introduced in Denmark in 1987 as a one-shot measles-mumps-rubella vaccine at 15‚Äâmonths, a timing chosen to avoid inhibition of the infant‚Äôs immune response by maternal antibodies. One generation later, the MMR vaccinated mothers have lower antibody levels compared to the naturally infected, and their infants are already susceptible at 6 months of age or earlier, thus increasing the risk of epidemics. The Danish MMR trial is a double-blind randomized clinical trial recruiting between March 2019 and December 2021 with last patient last visit in February 2022. Altogether N‚Äâ=‚Äâ6500 infants aged 6 months will be randomly assigned to intramuscular vaccination with routine MMR (M-M-R VaxPro) or placebo (solvent only).

Although the vaccines in an immunization series should be from a single manufacture, children sometimes have to receive EV71 vaccines from more than one manufacturers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interchangeability and safety of vaccination with EV71 vaccines from two manufacturers among Chinese children.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an open label and randomized controlled study among children aged 6-35‚ÄØmonths from November 2018 to January 2019. The participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive EV71 vaccines in one of the four different schedules (two using a single vaccine for all doses from one manufacture, and two mixed schedules using vaccines from two manufactures).

Efforts to develop an effective vaccine against malaria are underway and several vaccine prototypes are on different clinical trial phases. Objective: As many sub-Saharan African countries have shown interest in introducing large-scale infant vaccination against malaria when a definitively approved vaccine will be available, the present study aimed at mapping Mozambican parents‚Äô willingness to get their children vaccinated and comparing the results with findings from a similar study we conducted in Togo (209 participants). Methods: In Mozambique, 227 parents indicated their willingness to get their children vaccinated (using an 11-point scale) against malaria under different conditions varying as a function of the main constructs of health-protective theories: perceived risk of getting malaria, perceived severity of malaria, effectiveness of the vaccine, cost of the vaccine, and neighbors‚Äô attitude toward vaccination.

The effectiveness of current pertussis vaccines among properly vaccinated children <5¬†years is so high that a randomized trial is infeasible. Fluctuations in pertussis incidence and characteristics of the US vaccine marketplace make selection of suitable controls for a case-control study problematic. To satisfy an FDA requirement to evaluate rates of pertussis following licensure of Pentacel¬Æ vaccine, we used a case-cohort study design with a novel method for characterizing the cohort population.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis prospective, observational study was conducted in Wisconsin from 2010 to 2014 among Wisconsin residents <60¬†months of age who received ‚â§four doses of pertussis vaccine (surveillance population). Cases were identified by the Wisconsin Division of Public Health. Characteristics and pertussis vaccinations of the surveillance population were estimated by ongoing random telephonic survey. The primary objective was to determine rates of pertussis disease among those who received only Pentacel vaccine (Group 1) vs those who received a single brand of vaccine other than Pentacel vaccine (Group 2).\n\n\nRESULTS\n1195 pertussis cases were identified. It was estimated that the surveillance population accrued a total of 1,133,403 person-years (Group 1, 39%; Group 2, 41%; Group 3 [those not in Group 1 or Group 2], 20%). Pertussis rates were similar in Group 1 (98.9/100,000) and Group 2 (96.2/100,000); rate ratios were 1.03 (unadjusted; 90% CI, 0.92-1.15) and 0.99 (adjusted; 90% CI, 0.89-1.12). Persons with one or more delayed vaccinations had a 66% higher risk of pertussis (90% CI, 39-96%).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nPertussis protection was not found to differ for recipients of the newly licensed vs other available pertussis vaccines.

Healthy children aged 4-16 years were randomly assigned 2:1 (stratified by age and region) to receive two doses of TAK-003 or two doses of placebo, 3 months apart. Investigators, participants and their parents or guardians, and sponsor representatives advising on trial conduct were masked to trial group assignments. Participants presenting with febrile illness were tested for virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) by serotype-specific RT-PCR.

Originally developed for use in systemic oncology therapy eRAPID (electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice) is an online system for patients to report AEs from home. eRAPID enables patient data to be integrated into the electronic patient records for use in clinical practice, provides patient management advice for mild and moderate AE and advice to contact the hospital for severe AE.

Haley', 'Aim This audit explores the impact of regular pharmacist intervention monitoring and feedback on paediatric and maternity wards, and how these interventions guide educational strategies aimed at improving prescribing practice. Method A tally-chart data collection tool was designed for each ward to collect data on common errors such as omission of booking weight, vital to ensure safer prescribing of dalteparin, omission of dose/kg imperative to ensure safer paediatric prescribing, and also omission of the residing ward from the front of the chart which affects discharge times when TTOs are delayed/lost due to misdirection. The ward pharmacist recorded the incidence of these errors during each daily visit and prepared a weekly feedback report consisting of a bar graph of the results plus a comparison to the previous week. The pharmacist would also reiterate the importance of avoiding each type of error. This would also inform the topic of the ‚Äòkey prescribing message‚Äô (a bulletin focussing on a particular type of error) explaining the correct method and the significance of avoiding errors. This was communicated to the ward teams/prescribers. Results Preliminary audit data is encouraging and shows that the feedback to the ward teams has had a positive impact. Many nurses and midwives were surprised at the level of errors and now better understand their significance and how they can support accurate prescribing. The senior medics have taken an interest in the audit and are keen on sharing the information with their juniors and adapting their training to ensure that further improvements are made. The data collected informed the first ‚Äòkey prescribing messages‚Äô; ‚ÄòBooking weight‚Äô for maternity and ‚Äòmedicines reconciliation‚Äô for paediatrics. Since these were communicated to the ward teams/prescribers the audit has found an improvement in the number of maternity prescriptions with the booking weight recorded, a reduction in the number of incorrect dalteparin prescriptions for postnatal women, as well as improved prescribing practice in paediatrics such as including dose/kg on each prescription and improved drug-history taking by the medics. Conclusion A key priority of the NHS is the prevention of medication errors.1 The positive impact of clinical pharmacist interventions on the quality of prescribing is well established2,3 as highlighted in a Department of Health study4 reviewing the frequency of errors, identifying modes of good practice to improve safety. To date this audit has shown the benefit of increasing the multidisciplinary team awareness of common errors, monitoring these each week and sharing these findings with the team. It has also shown that short, focused bulletins encouraged improvement and helped prescribers to improve their practice. References Audit Commission.

Studies show that as many as 30% of patients do not receive acute care of proven effectiveness, and this can rise to 40% for chronic care. Moreover, as many as 30% of patients receive acute care that is unnecesary or potentially harmful. Much recent empirical research has focused on strategies to translate research evidence into clinical practice (www.rxforchange.ca). A systematic review of interventions to disseminate printed educational materials concluded that such interventions can be effective in improving process outcomes but not patient outcomes. Examples of other promising methods include audit and feedback (especially when baseline compliance is low and feedback is delivered more intensively), local opinion leaders (‚Äòchampions‚Äô), and reminders. The effects of any of these interventions considered separately are modest to moderate (10 to 15%). Combined (multifaceted) interventions aiming at acting on different barriers to change do not display a clear doseresponse relationship, however, it is plausible that multifaceted interventions built upon a careful assessment of barriers may be more effective than single interventions. Although most of this evidence is based on research in the care of adults, there has been one randomised controlled trial in neonatal care. The Vermont Oxford Network conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT), using a multifaceted collaborative quality improvement intervention (audit and feedback, lectures on reviews of the evidenced-based literature, an interactive training workshop and ongoing faculty support via conference calls and email) to promote evidence-based surfactant treatment for preterm babies born at 23‚àí29 weeks‚Äô gestation. This intervention was associated with a significant improvement (40%) in the earlier surfactant administration compared to usual dissemination strategies. A Acolet submitted_310111.doc 4 The Vermont Oxford trial, like most of the relevant literature, was based in North America. The main aim of the present study is to use the rigour of a randomised controlled trial in an evaluation comparing the effects of different approaches to knowledge transfer on policy and practice in the care of preterm babies in another setting. A Acolet submitted_310111.doc 5 METHODS The methods are reported in the published trial protocol. In summary, Project 27/28 conducted by the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) (now Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE)) provided the basis for this trial. Variations in standards of care were reported that may have contributed to the death of preterm babies born at 27 or 28 weeks‚Äô gestational age. The results and a dissemination package with PowerPoint slides were distributed to all UK Neonatal Units. To evaluate the impact on policy and practice of this dissemination, CEMACH sent a questionnaire to key UK recipients. Responses were received from 94 out of 262 neonatal/paediatric clinicians (36%), and 86 of the 183 acute hospitals with maternity services (47%). Threequarters of the respondents said they recalled receiving the dissemination package, and most reported using the slide package, finding it useful for raising awareness of the clinical issues and fostering the initiation and/or consolidation of policy and practice changes. However, gaps remained between the evidence and current practice. This led to a position statement on ‚ÄúEarly Care of Premature Babies‚Äù from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM). The aim of the BLISS cluster randomised controlled trial of the Effect of ‚ÄòActive Dissemination of Information‚Äô on standards of care for premature babies in England (BEADI) trial was to assess whether an evidence-based innovative ‚Äòactive‚Äô knowledge transfer strategy was more likely to lead to changes in policy and practice than the passive dissemination of the report, the slide package and the neonatal position statement on a website. A Acolet submitted_310111.doc 6 The intended effect was to change practice and policy at institutional level, therefore a CRCT where randomisation is by hospitals is the most appropriate design, as this allows the delivery of the intervention to be focused on all staff. Participants There were three levels: 1. Neonatal units: the 180 hospitals in England with neonatal intensive care units were identified at the beginning of 2006 by CEMACH working with the EPICure2 study group (http://www.epicure.ac.uk/epicure-2). 2. Lead clinicians from the Neonatal units (see under Interventions below for further details about their roles) 3. Babies born at <27 weeks‚Äô gestation in England in January-March 2007, iidentified using the CEMACH (now CMACE) nationwide network for data collection. Randomisation Neonatal Units were stratified by designation of level of care within the managed Clinical Neonatal Networks (n = 25) and by level of care delivered (level I, II or III), and then ordered alphabetically by name of hospital and imported into statistical computer software Stata 9 at LSHTM. The programme generated a series of blocks of varying size (two, four, or six) for each stratum and allocated units to control or active intervention randomly within each block. Interventions 1. Control arm: Clinicians in the control group had previously been sent the CEMACH Project 27/28 report which identified variations in standards of care that might have contributed to death in preterm babies born at 27 or 28 weeks gestation.

The resulting movement of ‚Äòevidence-based management‚Äô is premised on assumed positive consequences of managers making organisational decisions informed by research, rather than by personal experience alone. However, we know little about how health-care managers engage with information and knowledge in practice, especially at the highest level. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate how chief executive officers (CEOs) of NHS trusts make decisions and mobilise particular knowledge and ‚Äòevidence‚Äô in the course of their day-to-day activities. Design: The study was conducted between March 2011 and May 2013. We employed a qualitative naturalistic approach, combining in-depth observation with interviews and documentary analysis. Seven CEOs of acute and mental health NHS trusts in England were shadowed for an average of 5 weeks each. This sample included four women and three men. To protect the anonymity of our informants, and following customary academic practice in the social sciences, in this report we refer to all our participants using the female pronoun. We aimed to maximise sample diversity regarding professional background, career stage and organisational characteristics. Analysis was a reiterative process, led by two empirical researchers, who continuously examined emergent data and undertook cross-case comparative analysis. This was informed by team meetings, discussions with an expert advisory panel, and feedback from research participants and other senior NHS managers. Results: CEOs seek information and use knowledge all the time, for three main purposes: making decisions; accounting for decisions already made; and making sense. The last of these is by far the most common, with significant effort aimed at ‚Äòconnecting the dots‚Äô and constructing (‚Äòweaving‚Äô) a sense of the present and future for their own and others‚Äô consumption. This is most often accomplished conversationally, including via an inner conversational circle of trusted colleagues. CEOs very rarely mobilise knowledge in the canonical way described in many of the existing models ‚Äì though this does not make them poorly informed or irrational decision-makers. In particular, they rarely search, retrieve, consult and quote scientific and other forms of formalised evidence in person. Instead, they systematically ask others to do so and put in place the necessary mechanisms that allow them to progress from intuition to facts. Their knowledge and information work is therefore not so much about decision-making as about knowledgeability ‚Äì understood as a personal and organisational capability: knowledge-ability. How CEOs‚Äô knowledgeability is accomplished, why and in relation to what objects differs on the basis of a number of contextual factors, including the specific issue at hand, their personal style and the nature of everyday work. We define such an arrangement as the (personal) knowledgeability infrastructure of CEOs.

There are a number of skills that new CEOs may need to learn, and a number of skills, behaviours and attitudes that may need to change over time according to changing circumstances, for a CEO, to conduct her job successfully. Our findings suggest a framework for critically examining how, and how effectively, NHS managers may make themselves knowledgeable given the demands of their jobs.

There have been calls for evidence to reduce uncertainty regarding the identification of children who will and will not benefit from antibiotics. The aim of this feasibility trial is to test recruitment and the acceptance of a complex behavioural intervention designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing, and to inform how best to conduct a larger trial. Methods and analysis The CHICO (Childrens Cough) trial is a single-centre feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a web-based, within-consultation, behavioural intervention with usual care for children presenting to general practitioner practices with RTI and acute cough. The trial aims to recruit at least 300 children between October 2014 and April 2015, in a single area in South West England. Following informed consent, demographic information will be recorded, and symptoms and signs measured. Parents/carers of recruited children will be followed up on a weekly basis to establish symptom duration, resource use and cost of the illness to the parent until the childs cough has resolved or up to 8‚ÄÖweeks, whichever occurs earlier. A review of medical notes, including clinical history, primary care reconsultations and hospitalisations will be undertaken 2‚ÄÖmonths after recruitment. The trial feasibility will be assessed by: determining acceptability of the intervention to clinicians and parent/carers; quantifying differential recruitment and follow-up; determining intervention fidelity; the success in gathering the data necessary to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; and collecting data about antibiotic prescribing rates to inform the sample size needed for a fully powered RCT. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the North West‚ÄîHaydock Research Ethics Committee, UK (reference number: 14/NW/1034).

Since our foundation in 1984, the American Association for Cancer Education (AACE) has been a very strong and supportive partner. Like many small associations, we have faced difficult times throughout the years in terms of membership and the number of participants attending our annual meeting. As part of our cooperation, a strong participation from our AACE colleagues has helped us to move forward and to continue to provide interesting scientific meetings. Maria Bishop is one of our strongest supporters and EACE is delighted that she has been appointed Editor in Chief of the JCE. We look forward to strengthening our common effort in the development of cancer education. We would also like to acknowledge the work and support of Art Michalek during his time at the helm. This year, our annual scientific meeting was held in Haifa, Israel. Professor Gilad Amiel invited us to the RAMBAM Healthcare Campus where he is Chief of the Department of Urology. Along with his team of local organisers, we enjoyed a scientific program comprising two and a half days filled with oral presentations and workshops. As with all of our meetings, students were strongly encouraged to present their research or experiences related to education and training in oncology. As part of a successful mentoring program for students interested in Oncology at the University of Wroclaw, a strong group of Polish students attended our meeting. One of their presentations was about a summer workshop organised by a hospice in Poland, teaching students and young medical doctors how to improve their communication skills and inform patients about their disease and prognosis [1]. Training in communication skills, especially how to break bad news, is not routinely part of the medical curricula in some European countries. An Israeli student reported on the growing field of patient-centred palliative care in Israel and the need to develop special training programs for medical students. He presented a one week program taking place at the RAMBAMHealth Care Campus, teaching 4th‚Äì6th-year students basic knowledge about symptom control, end of life care and multidisciplinary team work [2]. A study from Australia was presented, focusing on student exposure to cancer patients and the nature of these encounters. Focus groups identified that basic oncology teaching was lacking and that the exposure to a cancer patient was opportunistic. Due to poor cancer knowledge, they felt uncomfortable in discussions about treatment and prognosis and uncertain about communication style [3]. Whilst, I simply cannot summarise all of the presentations, I want to highlight a few more. Poland is still experiencing low attendance rates of women in the nationwide mammography screening program, started in 2006, with only 37% of the invited women attending the program in 2016. Questionnaire data collected from 200 women highlighted that fear of pain during examination and fear of a positive result were the most common reasons for non-participation. As a result of this study, there will be a stronger focus on local education programs for women to better inform them about cancer prevention [4]. Non-participation in screening programs or misunderstanding of the information provided is often based on a lack of understanding of basic health care information. A very interesting workshop [5] on health literacy and how we can better enable patients to make informed health care decisions was well received by the delegates. The workshop demonstrated how to create a health literate friendly health care environment and ways in which we can improve our teaching and communication abilities. In attempting to understand the needs of our patients, it is necessary to consider both their cultural and religious needs. A student from Israel [6] presented a very interesting study about the differences between Arab breast cancer patients in the Galiliee compared to those living in the West Bank. There was a difference in * Sabine Fromm-Haidenberger', '2018', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=news+weeks+week+weekly+uk+informed+information+inform+team&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 29),

Van Egeren, A. A. Marshall, J. C. Gardiner, K. Maduschke, J. M. Stanley, G. Osborn, V. Shebroe, R. B. Greenbaum', 'Medical interviewing justifiably reigns as the premier skill in medicine [1-4] and is the vehicle for physicianpatient interaction and exchange of information in almost all circumstances [3, 4]. The interview alone produces the data required for diagnosis more than three fourths of the time, and it establishes more diagnoses than physical examination and laboratory data combined [5-8]. Interviewing generates most of the data required for treatment and prevention and is the primary means for transmitting information from physician to patient [4, 9]. It also defines the physicianpatient relationship, and the quality of the physicianpatient relationship influences the quality of the data exchanged [4, 10, 11]. Against this background, and with the knowledge that most physicians perform more than 200 000 interviews during their careers [3], it is a matter of national concern in the United States that the interview often gets short shrift [3]. Most medical schools teach at least some interviewing skills [12], but instruction in interviewing receives scant attention in residencies [9, 13-16], despite strong research-based recommendations in favor of such training [13, 17-20]. Surveys of internal medicine program directors [14, 21] showed that formal training in interviewing averaged only 5 to 13 hours per year during residencies. This is far less than the 1 month of full-time training that is often recommended [13, 17-2022, 23], but educators have few empirical data to guide them with respect to what and how to teach residents in intensive interviewing training programs. A recent literature review produced only 12 studies of intensive training programs, and 6 of the 12 had nonexperimental designs [13]. Of the 6 with quasi-experimental designs, 4 [17-20] specifically addressed interviewing, interpersonal skills, or the physicianpatient relationship and showed positive results, thus supporting a patient-centered approach. The other 2 studies [24, 25] did not inform the question [13]. We developed an intensive training program for primary care residents in interviewing and related psychosocial topics in medicine. Using a randomized, controlled study design, we tested two hypotheses: 1) that trained residents, compared with controls, could gain more knowledge, confidence, and skill in gathering data, building relationships with patients, managing somatizing patients, and educating patients and 2) that the patients of trained residents would have greater satisfaction, fewer somatic symptoms, less social dysfunction, less depression and anxiety, and reduced functional disability. Methods Participants We trained 65 medical and family practice residents in postgraduate year 1 and asked them to participate in a study to evaluate the interviewing training program. Thirty-six men and 27 women accepted; 2 residents who were trained refused to participate in the evaluation. Each participant was paid $100 to participate in the evaluation. Training Program As described elsewhere [26, 27], training was experiential and skills oriented and was guided by competency-based [28] objectives that were both learner- and teacher-centered [29, 30]. To enhance learning of complex new material, we used the four interviewing models described below. Each model described the step-by-step behaviors needed to efficiently conduct a complex interaction with a patient, placed these behaviors in sequence, and prioritized them. Basic Patient-Centered Interviewing and Physician-Patient Relationship Model One of the authors formulated a basic model of the entire interview to serve as an infrastructure that learners could use as a guide [4]. The model incorporated a rich body of literature, reviewed elsewhere [4] (a textbook from the American Academy on Physician and Patient is a particularly useful guide for teachers [31]). We restricted our focus to the often unfamiliar patient-centered interviewing process, which places the patients needs and the physicianpatient relationship first [4], because residents were already relatively skilled with the physician-centered interviewing process aimed at diagnosing disease. The patient-centered process, which was usually used at the start of the interview, was easily learned and was structured so that, with experience, it usually took no more than 3 to 10 minutes. Other Patient-Centered Interviewing Models Other interviewing models used the basic patient-centered model and integrated it with additional patient-centered skill areas: 1) interacting with patients who had chronic somatization by using cognitive-behavioral principles developed by one of the authors [32, 33], 2) informing the patient and motivating the patient to take a new course of action (such as losing weight) by using a model developed by one of the authors [34] and others ([4, 35-39]; Vispoel WP, Chen P. Measuring self-efficacy: the state of the art (Presented paper. Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association; 1990; Boston.), and 3) giving patients bad news by using published approaches [4, 40]. Noninterviewing Training Objectives This learning experience encompassed several important objectives apart from interviewing skills. It was intended to help residents develop self-awareness of potentially harmful personal reactions [41-43]; be able to make accurate neuropsychiatric diagnoses for conditions common in primary care settings [44-48]; be skilled with practical psychopharmacology in a medical setting [44]; and be skilled in treating anxiety, depression, and chronic somatization in primary care settings [32, 33, 44, 45, 47, 49]. Training took place during a required, full-time, 4-week block rotation, in which three or four residents matriculated at a time. The rotation had a core seminar component and a core supervisory component. Core seminar sessions of 3 hours each took place three times weekly in a private conference room. A brief discussion of the interviewing model (or other objective) was followed by demonstration of and repeated practice with the model through role playing [50]. The training allowed residents to achieve significant mastery of new, complex, and often counterintuitive interviewing skills before they tried them with actual patients, and it was designed to foster confidence ([30, 51, 52]; Tresolini CP, Stritter FT. Medical students development of self-efficacy in conducting patient education for health promotion: an analysis of learning experiences [Presented paper]. Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association; 1992; San Francisco.). Supervisory sessions lasting 3 hours each took place daily and involved inpatient and outpatient interviews that were observed directly or from prerecorded audiotapes. The focus of the seminar and supervisory teaching sessions was efficient data gathering, emotion handling, patient education, and management of psychosocial and psychiatric problems common in primary care settings. Integrated throughout was a strong emphasis on the development of residents self-awareness, as detailed elsewhere [4, 41-43]. We gave residents a syllabus of required readings and other materials (copies of these documents are available from the authors). Experimental Procedure Residents were randomly assigned to receive training either during the first 6 months of postgraduate year 1 (training group) or later in postgraduate year 1, after they served as controls (control group). An effort to assign equal numbers of men and women to the training and control groups was limited by scheduling constraints. Fifteen women and 16 men (16 graduates of international schools and 15 graduates of U.S. schools) served as trainees, and 12 women and 20 men (15 international graduates and 17 U.S. graduates) served as controls. No international graduates were U.S. citizens. Residents interviewing skills were assessed through evaluations of audiotaped recordings of outpatient clinic visits (for all residents during all 4 years of the st', '1998', 253, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=news+weeks+week+weekly+uk+informed+information+inform+team&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 29),

Kehoe, Sarah Murphy', 'Background : This audit was completed within a large teaching hospital in Dublin, St Vincents University Hospital. The cohort of patients are those admitted with an acute stroke under the care of the Stroke Multidisciplinary Team, with confirmed stroke on CTBrain/MRI. Problem : It has always been assumed that poor cognitive scores were associated with longer lengths of stays and increased likelihood of discharge to a location other than the patient‚Äôs home. Stroke patients can often wait months to access appropriate care packages, further rehab settings or long term care beds resulting in significant costs as well as causing frustration for patients and their families alike. Achieving safe, timely and person centred discharge from hospital to home is an important indicator of quality and a measure of effective and integrated care (Joint Improvement Team, HSE 2014) Improvement related question : We set out to confirm if early cognitive screening of acute stroke patients in a large Dublin teaching hospital could predict their discharge destination and length of stay. This has never been examined previously within an Irish/UK stroke population using a standardised cognitive assessment (MoCA). Methods : We completed a retrospective audit using paper count method on the charts of 120 newly diagnosed stroke patients admitted to St Vincents University Hospital over a six month period. The proforma gathered information on patient sex, age, date of admission, length of stay, CT/MRI results, admission Barthel, MOCA score on initial assessment, discharge Barthel score and discharge destination. Intervention/Results : 120 patients were included in the audit with a confirmed stroke on CTB/MRI. The average age was 73. There were 52 males and 68 females and the average length of stay was 44 days. Of the 49 patients that scored within mild-no cognitive impairment, 90% (n=44) went home from SVUH, 2% to further rehab, 6% to LTC and 2% died . The average length of stay for this cohort is 17 days. Of those that scored within the mild- moderate cognitive impairment (n=37) 30% went home, 40% went for further rehab, 27% went to LTC and 3% died. The average length of stay for this group was 49 days (more than twice the first group). Of those that scored within moderate ‚Äì severe cognitive impairment, 12% went for further rehab, 63% to long term care and 25% died and 0% went home. Their average length of stay was 90days, nearly five times longer than the first cohort. Not every patient was able to complete a standardised cognitive assessment. 42% of these patients went to long-term care and 35% died. This cohorts average length of stay was 82 days, with a the number of deaths shortly after admission Lessons Learnt : The results of this audit confirm that early cognitive screening can help predict discharge destination and length of stay. Early cognitive screening (as recommended in the Royal College Of Physicians Stroke guidelines) are completed within 24 hours of admission to SVUH. Therefore the multidisciplinary has a strong indicator of discharge destination and length of stay early in the course of the patient‚Äôs hospital stay. With an increasing emphasis on the delivery of appropriate allocation of resources and constant pressures on delivering cost effective care it is estimated this knowledge will have significant cost saving benefits. This information is also imperative in early planning to reduce the number of delayed discharges. Effects of changes : As a multidisciplinary team we now use these early cognitive scores prospectively, to inform discharge arrangements and the timeliness of interventions for newly diagnosed stroke patients. Family meetings are now arranged within two weeks of admissions as standard, meaning families/NOK are also informed and involved in effective early discharge planning, allowing for a more seamless discharge. We anticipate that this focus on early scores might assist in the better distribution of healthcare resources in the hospital setting.', '2017', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=news+weeks+week+weekly+uk+informed+information+inform+team&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 29),

Butler, S. Rajpopat, A. Sahota, Virginia Hubbard, V. Jolliffe', 'Dear Editor Consultations in general practice regarding patients with a dermatological complaint are estimated to account for 10‚Äì24% of primary care doctor-patient contacts in the UK [1,2] and yet for most doctors embarking on a career in general practice an undergraduate attachment in dermatology lasts on average two weeks.[3] There is concern that currently dermatology training in medical schools is not adequately providing the diagnostic skills to meet these needs.[4,5] As a result, most general practitioners feel ill-equipped to diagnose and manage the range of dermatological conditions which form a significant part of their consultation workloads. This lack of knowledge may contribute to increasing referral patterns to secondary and tertiary care, at a time when the provision of dermatological services and the dermatology workforce in secondary care is in crisis.[6] Having developed significantly since its conception, the Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Dermatology (www. londondermatology.org) consists of six online modules encompassing the core dermatological curriculum delivered via an e-learning online platform using Moodle, alongside six clinical teaching days where in-person attendance permits small group consultant-led clinical teaching, using live patient cases and interactive lectures. The weekly modules incorporate blended learning, with written core material supplemented by extensive use of video and audio linked material. We set out to evaluate the perceived effects on clinical practice following the completion of this course and whether the course was effective in providing relevant and sustained knowledge. Ninety-one doctors who had completed the course in 2013 and 2014 were invited to complete an electronic survey comprising a series of closeended and open-ended questions. The participation in the survey was voluntary and the data was gathered anonymously. Participants received detailed information about the study on which they provided their informed consent and there was no reward for completing the survey. Following a detailed review of ethical considerations, formal ethical approval was not deemed necessary as advised by the RCP/UCL PG Certificate in Medical Education academic team. A total of 29 doctors completed the survey giving a 32% response rate. Most respondents reported being very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the knowledge gained on the course (Table 1). They reported feeling more competent at diagnosing skin conditions and at prescribing specific treatments including appropriate use of topical steroids for skin conditions. With regards to specific areas of dermatology, respondents felt more confident about detection of skin cancer, management of acne, managing chronic skin conditions, understanding the psychological impact of skin conditions and management of hair loss. The main self‚Äìreported behavioural changes were more positive attitudes towards patients with skin conditions, better understanding of impact of skin disease, improvements in communication, increased confidence in diagnosing and treating patients with skin conditions (and at prescribing specific treatments including appropriate use of topical steroids), and knowledge dissemination to other general practitioners (GPs). Doctors have observed increased compliance with the treatments resulting in better patient outcomes. This is consistent with literature observations of the importance of educating GPs about topical steroid safety and use. GPs are usually the main source of information for patients and fears about topical steroids have a negative impact on compliance.[7] Previous literature demonstrated the mismatch between management of skin conditions in primary care and patients‚Äô needs and the importance of improving GPs‚Äô awareness in order to improve patient outcomes.[8] It appears that completion of the Diploma addresses this important aspect of patient care. A number of GPs, however, complained of barriers that prevent them from putting learning into practice including difficulties meeting further requirements to become a GP with a Special Interest (GPwSI) and current rigid guidelines regarding patient care pathways and requirements for skin surgery.[9,10] A large number of GPs reported that they have perceived a reduction in the number of', '2016', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=news+weeks+week+weekly+uk+informed+information+inform+team&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 29),

There were six states that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 elections and then for Donald Trump in 2016. In one state, Florida, voting shifts among the 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections were small. However, in the other five states, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the voting shift was large, and it is the shifts in these states that largely account for Trump‚Äôs Electoral College win. This article documents concentration of voting shifts in these and nearby states. These states share certain characteristics in common, including specialization in manufacturing, slow population growth, a common pattern with regards to Hispanic population change, and higher-than-average percentages of non-college-educated whites. In all of these states, disproportionate numbers of people voted twice for Obama and then for Trump.

Institutional reforms to voter registration produce only small impacts on participation. We show the registration barrier can be reduced without changing laws or administrative processes using official communication seeking to change individual political behavior. In collaboration with state election agencies in two states, we conducted large-scale field experiments using low cost postcards aimed at increasing registration among eligible but unregistered citizens. The experiments find statistically and substantively significant effects on registration and turnout in subsequent elections. The research partnership with election officials is unusual and important for understanding electoral participation. Further, the population targeted for registration is broader than prior experiments on voter registration in the US.

Medenica, Matt Fowler', 'Abstract While much attention has been paid to understanding the drivers of support for Donald Trump, less focus has been placed on understanding the factors that led individuals to turn out and vote or stay home. This paper compares non-voters and voters in the 2016 election and explores how self-reported candidate preference prior to the election predicted turnout across three different state contexts: (1) all states, (2) closely contested states won by Trump, and (3) closely contested states won by Clinton. We find that preference for both candidates predicted turnout in the aggregate (all states) and in closely contested states won by Clinton, but only preference for Trump predicted turnout in the closely contested states won by Trump. Moreover, we find that political interest is negatively associated with preference for Clinton when examining candidate preferences among non-voters. Our analysis suggests that non-voters in the 2016 election held meaningful candidate preferences that impacted voter turnout but that state context played an important role in this relationship. This study sheds light on an understudied component of the 2016 election, the attitudes and behavior of non-voters, as well as points to the importance of incorporating contextual variation in future work on electoral behavior and voter turnout.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+elections+election+state+states+voters+voter+gop&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 32),

While proponents argue these laws prevent voter fraud and protect the integrity of elections, opponents argue they disenfranchise low-income and minority voters. In this paper, we document the extent to which these laws can affect voter turnout and election outcomes. We do so using historical data on more than 2,000 races in Florida and Michigan, which both allow and track ballots cast without identification. Results indicate that at most only 0.10% and 0.31% of total votes cast in each state were cast without IDs. Thus, even under the extreme assumption that all voters without IDs were either fraudulent or would be disenfranchised by a strict law, the enactment of such a law would have only a very small effect on turnout. Similarly, we also show under a range of conservative assumptions that very few election results could have been flipped due to a strict law. Collectively, our findings indicate that even if the worst fears of proponents or critics were true, strict identification laws are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on turnout or election outcomes.', '2019', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+elections+election+state+states+voters+voter+gop&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 32),

Previous research has focused on measuring political bias of search engine algorithms to detect possible search engine manipulation effects on voters or unbalanced ideological representation in search results. Insofar that these concerns are related to the principle of fairness, this notion of fairness can be seen as explicitly oriented toward election candidates or political processes and only implicitly oriented toward the public at large. Thus, we ask the following research question: how should an auditing framework that is explicitly centered on the principle of ensuring and maximizing fairness for the public (i.e., voters) operate? To answer this question, we qualitatively explore four datasets about elections and politics in the United States: 1) a survey of eligible U.S. voters about their information needs ahead of the 2018 U.S. elections, 2) a dataset of biased political phrases used in a large-scale Google audit ahead of the 2018 U.S. election, 3) Googles \"related searches\" phrases for two groups of political candidates in the 2018 U.S. election (one group is composed entirely of women), and 4) autocomplete suggestions and result pages for a set of searches on the day of a statewide election in the U.S. state of Virginia in 2019.

Analysis of the results confirmed relatively low-trust levels for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and an electorate divided demographically about their trust in the two candidates. The five trust drivers yielded statistically significant differences between the candidates. Clinton was evaluated as more competent, concerned, and reliable, and a person with whom participants identified. With the second survey, Trump statistically surpassed Clinton for openness and honesty. Regarding the three issues of most importance in the campaign, Clinton and Trump had equivalent trust evaluations for dealing with the U.S. economy/jobs, but Trump was more trusted regarding terrorism/national security and Clinton was more trusted regarding health care. The overall trust evaluations for Clinton, coupled with intentions to vote, contribute to understanding Clinton‚Äôs popular vote victory.

Yet cyber statecraft research has focused more on operations designed to yield a direct military advantage or reward, rather than as a subtle tool of influence. We seek to address this gap in the literature, first by conceptualising a typology of state-sponsored operations constituting ‚Äòcyber voter interference‚Äô (CVI), second by theorising a causal mechanism through which CVI can influence the cognition and behaviour of voters contingent on specific local conditions within a target state, and third by testing the plausibility of our theoretical model via two case studies of recent elections in the United States and France, both of which saw credible accusations of cyber interference by hostile foreign actors.

Voter‚Äôs knowledge about voter fraud allegations likely comes through the media, who tend to sensationalize the issue. In this study, we argue that the more voters are exposed to media coverage of voter fraud allegations, the more likely that they will perceive that voter fraud is a frequent problem. We merge the 2012 Survey of Performance of American Elections with state-level media coverage of voter fraud leading up to the 2012 election. Our results show that media coverage of voter fraud is associated with public beliefs about voter fraud. In states where fraud was more frequently featured in local media outlets, public concerns about voter fraud were heightened. In particular, we find that press attention to voter fraud has a larger influence on Republicans than Democrats and Independents. We further find that media coverage of voter fraud does not further polarize partisan perceptions of voter fraud. Rather, political interest moderates state media coverage on voter fraud beliefs only among Republicans. Last, our results provide no support that demographic changes, approval of election administration, or information concerning actual reported voting irregularities have any discernable effects on partisan perceptions.', '2018', 7, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=trump+elections+election+state+states+voters+voter+gop&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 32),

While evidence suggests previous iterations of the GGR negatively impacted sexual and reproductive health outcomes, no studies have quantitatively assessed the impacts of the Trump administration‚Äôs GGR. Methods We constructed a panel dataset of facilities (76% public) using 2017/2018 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 service delivery point (SDP) surveys in Uganda. Based on information from stakeholder meetings, we classified districts as more or less exposed to the GGR; 45% (N = 34) of study districts were classified as ‚Äúmore exposed‚Äù, which corresponded to 145 ‚Äúmore exposed‚Äù and 142 ‚Äúless exposed‚Äù health facilities in our sample. We assessed changes in provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives, contraceptive stock-outs, mobile outreach services, engagement with community health workers (CHWs), service integration, and quality of care from 2017 (pre-GGR) to 2018 (post-GGR). Multivariable regression models were estimated, and difference-in-differences impact estimators were determined by calculating predicted probabilities from interaction terms for exposure and survey round. Findings We observed no immediate impact of the GGR on the provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives, contraceptive stock-outs, mobile outreach services, service integration, or quality of care. We did observe a significant impact of the policy on the average number of CHWs, with ‚Äúmore exposed‚Äù facilities engaging 3.8 fewer CHWs post-GGR (95% CI:-7.31,-0.32). Conclusions The reduction in CHWs could reduce contraceptive use and increase unintended pregnancies in Uganda. The lack of other significant findings may not be surprising given the short post-GGR observation window.

Throughout refugee‚Äôs crisis, the Jordanian Government has adopted several healthcare access policies to meet the health needs of Syrian refugees while maintaining the stability of the health-care system. The adopted health-care provision policies ranged from enabling to restricting and from affordable to unaffordable. The purpose of this paper is to identify the influence of restricted level of access to essential health services among Syrian refugees in Jordan.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper used findings of a cross-sectional surveys conducted over urban Syrian refugees in Jordan in 2017 and 2018 over two different health-care access policies. The first were inclusive and affordable, whereas the other considered very restricting policy owing to high inflation in health-care cost. Access indicators from four main thematic areas were selected including maternal health, family planning, child health and monthly access of household. A comparison between both years‚Äô access indicators was conducted to understand access barriers and its impact.\n\n\nFindings\nThe comparison between findings of both surveys shows a sudden shift in health-care access and utilization behaviors with increased barriers level thus increased health vulnerabilities. Additionally, the finding during implementation of restricted access policy proves the tendency among some refugees groups to adopt negative adaptation strategies to reduce health-care cost. The participants shifted to use a fragmented health-care, reduced or delayed care seeking and use drugs irrationally weather by self-medication or reduce drug intake.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nUnderstanding access barriers to health services and its negative short-term and long-term impact on refugees‚Äô health status as well as the extended risks to the host communities will help states that hosting refugees building rational access policy to protect whole community and save public health gains during and post crisis.

('oct+douglas+went+stephen+public', 1, 'Stephen A. Douglas and Antebellum Democracy', 'G. Peck', 'Stephen A. Douglas and Antebellum Democracy. By Martin H. Quitt. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. Pp. xv, 210, appendix, index. Paper, $24.99.)Martin H. Quitts interpretation of Stephen A. Douglas is intriguing, and original. Quitt contends that Douglas experiences as a youth and young adult left a psychological imprint that shaped his subsequent political career. Douglas early life certainly was difficult. His father died when he was two months old, and he grew up on his uncles farm, apparently resenting the labor required of him. He apprenticed as a cabinet maker until his small frame and poor health forced him to attend Brandon Academy, where, Quitt maintains, he had \"unrequited\" longings for another boy (p.25). Consequently, in 1830, when his mother married a farmer in upstate New York, Douglas willingly departed Vermont at the age of 17. His two years at Canandaigua Academy and six months at a local law firm proved more rewarding, bringing to life his considerable intellectual gifts. However, New York statutes required seven years of legal and classical study for admission to the bar, which presented a different obstacle to his ambition. Hence, in 1833, at the age of 20, he chose to leave for the West, and soon settled in Illinois.According to Quitt, Douglas experiences in Illinois radically altered his outlook. Within months, he went from an impecunious traveler to a leading organizer of the states Democratic Party; within a year he orchestrated passage of a major bill through the statehouse; within two years he was appointed states attorney; within three years he was elected to the legislature; within four years he had been appointed registrar of the Federal Land Office in Springfield; and within five years he had been nominated for Congress. In contrast with the East, which circumscribed his opportunities, the West presented a limitless horizon of possibility.The Democratic Party also played a liberating psychological role. Largely excluding women, the party provided an environment for Douglas and other young men to express their masculinity and assert their political equality regardless of perceived social standing. Douglas throve in this setting, using his formidable intellect and oratorical skill to trounce political opponents. For the first time, he experienced emotional fulfillment, reveling in the rapturous support he received from young Democrats who idolized him, cheered him, and literally lifted him on their shoulders after speeches. In contrast to his emotional distance with all but one of his eastern relatives, he embraced the voting public in spirit and in flesh, eating with them, sleeping with them, and even sitting on their laps. ‚Ä¶', '2013', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+douglas+went+stephen+public&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 34),
('oct+douglas+went+stephen+public', 2, 'Secession Debated: Georgias Showdown in 1860', 'William W. Freehling, C. Simpson', 'The critical northern antebellum debate matched the rhetorical skills of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in an historic argument over the future of slavery in a westward-expanding America. Two years later, an equally historic oratorical showdown between secessionists and Unionists in Georgia generated as much popular interest south of the Mason-Dixon line, and perhaps had an even more profound immediate effect on the future of the United States. With Abraham Lincolns \"Black Republican\" triumph in the presidential election of 1860 came ardent secessionist sentiment in the South. But Unionists were equally zealous and while South Carolina-a bastion of Disunionism since 1832-seemed certain to secede, the other fourteen slave states were far from decided. In the deep South, the road to disunion depended much on the actions of Georgia, a veritable microcosm of the divided South and geographically in the middle of the Cotton South. If Georgia went for the Union, secessionist South Carolina could be isolated. So in November of 1860 all the eyes of Dixie turned to tiny Milledgeville, pre-war capital of Georgia, for a legislative confrontation that would help chart the course toward civil war. In Secession Debated, William W. Freehling and Craig M. Simpson have for the first time collected the seven surviving speeches and public letters of this greatest of southern debates over disunion, providing todays reader with a unique window into a moment of American crisis. Introducing the debate and debaters in compelling fashion, the editors help bring to life a sleepy Southern town suddenly alive with importance as a divided legislature met to decide the fate of Georgia, and by extension, that of the nation. We hear myriad voices, among them the energetic and self-righteous governor Joseph E. Brown who, while a slaveholder and secessionist, was somewhat suspect as a native North Georgian; Alexander H. Stephens, the eloquent Unionist whose \"calm dispassionate approach\" ultimately backfired; and fiery secessionist Robert Toombs who, impatient with Browns indecisiveness and the caution of the Unionists, shouted to legislators: \"Give me the sword! but if you do not place it in my hands, before God! I will take it.\" The secessionists Henry Benning and Thomas R.R. Cobb as well as the Unionists Benjamin Hill and Herschel Johnson also speak to us across the years, most with eloquence, all with the patriotic, passionate conviction that defined an era. In the end, the legislature adopted a convention bill which decreed a popular vote on the issue in early January, 1861. The election results were close, mirroring the intense debate of two months before: 51% of Georgians favored immediate secession, a slim margin which the propaganda-conscious Brown later inflated to 58%. On January 19th the Georgia Convention sanctioned secession in a 166-130 vote, and the imminent Confederacy had its Southern hinge. Secession Debated is a colorful and gripping tale told in the words of the actual participants, one which sheds new light on one of the great and hitherto neglected verbal showdowns in American history. It is essential to a full understanding of the origins of the war between the states.', '1992', 24, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+douglas+went+stephen+public&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 34),

('oct+douglas+went+stephen+public', 4, 'Late Learners', 'Kim Richard Nossal', 'Looking at the process that the Conservative government of Stephen Harper tried to use to replace the Royal Canadian Air Forces aging CF-18 Hornet fleet with 65 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, it is hard to disagree with Andrew Coynes assessment that the acquisition program was \"a fiasco from top to bottom, combining lapses of professional ethics, ministerial responsibility and democratic accountability into one spectacular illustration of how completely our system of government has gone to hell.\"1 For the evolution of Canadas participation in the F-35 program-from the first memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the Liberal government of Jean Chretien on 2 January 1998 to the so-called \"reset\" of the program in December 2012-readily fits the nouns the Canadian media so commonly used to characterize the F-35 acquisition: fiasco, debacle, mess, scandal, and shambles in English, or fiasco, scandale, incompetence, g√¢chis (mess), gouffre financier (\"money pit\") in French.Because the F-35 acquisition in Canada went so badly off the rails, it inevitably invites comparison with the last time the Canadian government had to replace an aging fleet of fighter aircraft. By the early 1970s, Canadas mixed fleet of fighter aircraft-CF-101 Voodoos, CF-104 Starfighters, and CF-5 Freedom Fighters-all were coming to the end of their expected service lives. The Liberal government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau was determined to replace the mixed fleet of Air Command-as the Royal Canadian Air Force was then called-with a single multi-role fighter aircraft. It approved the New Fighter Aircraft (NFA) program on 17 March 1977, and three years later, on 10 April 1980, the cabinet formally selected the F-18/A Hornet, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation (as it was before its merger with Boeing Corporation in 1997). In 1982 the first of 130 aircraft began to be delivered to Canada.While the CF-18 acquisition was not without its controversial aspects, the procurement process itself has been widely hailed as a model of rational defence procurement-2 Certainly that was the conclusion that Michael M. Atkinson and I reached 30 years ago, when as junior political scientists at McMaster University we researched the CF-18 procurement.3 Others who examined the NFA program after we did drew similar conclusions. Looking at the NFA in comparative perspective in the late 1980s, for example, Frank L. Boyd Jr. characterized it as \"one of the most rational decisions\" in defence procurement.4 Likewise, Martin Shadwick noted that in 1980 there was a \"strong and prompt consensus\" across the government that the CF-18 was the right choice.5 More recently, Anton Bezglasnyy and Douglas A. Ross have argued the NFA procurement was a \"success story\": the NFA process \"produced a capable aircraft for the air force, a big boost to domestic aerospace manufacturing, and all at an acceptable cost.\"6What accounts for such a major difference in the politics of fighter procurement in just one generation? What lessons, if any, might we draw from this historical procurement? In this paper I argue that the lessons from the NFA program of the late 1970s were not learned by the Conservative government, because, I suggest, the Conservatives came to office in February 2006 with particular blind spots that caused them to overlook the implications of the governing structure for the replacement of the CF-18 fleet that they inherited from the Liberals. As a result, the F-35 program derailed quickly, and by the time the Harper government had imposed a new governing structure on the program, it was too late to do anything but \"reset\" the replacement program.GETTING IT RIGHT: THE NFA ACQUISITION7On 17 March 1977 the Trudeau cabinet approved the NFA program, creating an interdepartmental NFA Program Office (NFA/PO), staffed by officials of the Department of National Defence (DND); the Department of Industry, Trade, and Commerce; and the Department of Supply and Services (as Industry Canada and Public Works and Government Services Canada were then known). ‚Ä¶', '2013', 9, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+douglas+went+stephen+public&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 34),

Retooling anthropology A response to Hart/Ortiz and Gudeman (AT24[6]) Keith Hart, Horacio Ortiz and Steven Gudeman make provocative suggestions for retooling the analytical apparatus of anthro- pology as we all get caught up in various ways ‚Äì intellectual and personal ‚Äì in the current moment. We share Hart and Ortiz‚Äôs pedagogical impulse to send us all back to reading Polanyi and Mauss. And we appreciate Gudeman‚Äôs tracking of inequality and spheres of exchange. Yet we have also begun to appre- ciate just how much is lacking in our field‚Äôs ability to make sense of the crisis we are all living through. Anthropology has a lot to con- tribute to thoughts about the current moment, but may need to re-equip itself by studying mainstream economics, the field in which our new ‚Äònatives‚Äô have been schooled. Gudeman has an MBA and Ortiz has in-depth research experience in the world of banking. However, most of us have an oversimplified view of what economists and specialists in the world of finance believe in, leaving us with insufficient analytic and technical tools to make sense of what is going on. Using anthropology‚Äôs signature method to document what is happening at the micro- level, informed by a higher level of knowledge about the history and meaning of the concepts and tools at work in the world of finance, might afford new insights and suggest other avenues for research. These might, in Michel Callon‚Äôs terms, involve research among those ‚Äòeconomists in the wild‚Äô who are making ‚Äòeconomic‚Äô decisions and theories every day outside of economics‚Äô formal location in the academy, from the soup kitchens feeding newly hungry families to the chambers of the Senate Finance Committee. We imagine anthropologists fanning out and doing very traditional ethnographic work of the kind that has fallen out of fashion in the profession. We need to do a Roosevelt-style WPA project. We could be sending out students to follow the lives of people in our communities who are losing their homes to foreclosure, who are being fired, who cannot pay the bills, who cannot retire, and who are seeing a complete change of their lives and horizons in a very short space of time. We could be doing ethnog- raphies of loans, and tracking the journey of a loan ‚Äì where it went, what it turned into, and who was affected along the way. We need to be thinking about why the current moment is still, by and large, being experienced as a series of personal tragedies (how many exchanged details of losses from their retirement accounts at the recent AAA meetings? How many of us face bankruptcy and foreclosure as political issues?), while in the 1930s and 40s they were felt as part of a broad social experience. Marieke de Goede, in her prescient review essay on finance in the Economic Sociology European Electronic Newsletter, made the connection between the 1930s and the early 2000s before the ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô was even announced. Hart, Ortiz and Gudeman provide excellent suggestions for an anthropology of this crisis. Can we trace the loans and the relationships undergirding them in the way we have done in studying everything from Melanesian kula to Egyptian microcredit and Nigerian informal economies? What would such analysis offer? First, it would afford another modality of engagement with our informants and our audi- ence, current and potential. It would allow us to learn the languages and the practices of the people in the financial and banking sec- tors who are desperately trying to keep their own jobs while they travel around the world assigning value to things, relationships and contracts and deciding who gets foreclosed, fired, furloughed and who does not. It would contribute to a deeper understanding of the regulatory policy issues, too, as Douglas Holmes has been suggesting for some time in his work on and with central bankers. It is not clear to us that the Washington Consensus is defunct, or that endings and beginnings are so easily definable anymore. Deregulation marched on in areas of policy kept under wraps by officials in the waning weeks of the Bush administration. At the same time, elements of a new Keynesianism seem to be emerging. Our analytical vocabularies are inadequate to capture this. We need a return to practice, alongside the practitioners who have been thrown into this situation with little to fall back on. The ideological questions should be put aside as we delve into practices that people are using regardless of ideology to do basic, yet for anthropologists and many others, still opaque tasks like assigning value to things and figuring out just what, exactly, has happened in recent months. The winks of financial micropractices speak to the episte- mologies swirling chaotically around finance and everyday life. What can anthropologists do?

It surfaced only hours after the journal Nature published a scathing editorial calling for the end of the Human Terrain System, following a series of scandals in the programme. 2 Much of the document consists of general guidelines for HTTs operating in Iraq and Afghanistan. It reviews teams‚Äô responsibilities, interview techniques, and ‚Äòhow to effectively brief‚Äô commanders. The handbook also con- firms accounts about the everyday workings of HTTs: teams accompany units on patrols to gather census data, to uncover kinship, reli- gious and political networks, and to ‚Äòcollect a great deal of unintended information‚Äô (pp. 5-6); they are ‚Äòattached to the unit and belong to the Commander, who employs the team as he needs them‚Äô (p. 28); they use the ‚ÄòMAP-HT toolkit‚Äô software ‚Äòto capture, consolidate, tag, and ingest human terrain data‚Äô (p. 34); and they undertake ‚Äòcultural preparation‚Äô of the battlefield, following ‚Äòthe same doctrinal principles and four-step methodology of tra- ditional IPB [Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield]‚Äô (pp. 49-50). The efforts of HTTs should at all times be ‚ÄòOPERATIONALLY RELEVANT‚Äô to commanders (p. 61). The handbook is filled with glaring omis- sions. For example, there is no mention what- soever of BAE Systems, the corporation that has been granted the lucrative contract for managing the programme (and training HTT members) since its inception in 2006. Nor is there any guidance about how team mem- bers might reconcile conflicting obligations to their employer (BAE Systems), US Army commanders, and Iraqi and Afghan research subjects.

This is my first MEA conference. My lack of attendance, however, should not be interpreted as a lack of interest in media ecology studies. My first publication while still a graduate student was a 1967 article, safely buried away in The Ohio Speech Journal, on Marshall McLuhan. It grew into a book chapter in 1971, and something more substantial for ‚ÄúThe Living McLuhan‚Äù number of the Journal of Communication in 1981. Then in the 1980s, I was invited to head up an editorial team including Tom Farrell and Paul Soukup to prepare a festschrift to Walter Ong. As I got to London, where SLU‚Äôs Centre for the Study of Communication and Culture then was housed and where an Ong library had been assembled, I figured out why a Lutheran was brought in for the project: The Jesuits needed someone to start supper and set up the bar and cigars during evening prayer. A Protestant who could cook and knew his liquor was perfect for the job. So thanks to that month in London in 1987, I became not only a minion for the Society of Jesus but also much more deeply immersed in media ecology studies. I must emphasize, however, that I have not been particularly interested in media ecology as a communication theory per se. Long ago, my M.A. adviser, rhetorician Douglas Ehninger, told me to stay out of theory‚Äîboth my writing and thinking, he observed, went to hell when I tried to argue theoretically. I moved to historical-critical rhetorical studies. My interests in matters visual and performative came by teaching students how to analyze speeches, then television, film, and the idea of publicly massed bodies as rhetorical texts. I‚Äôd not yet read Roland Barthes‚Äô Elements of Semiology (1964/1977) nor had Stephen Heath yet pulled together Barthes‚Äô great essays on film and photography (Image‚ÄîMusic‚ÄîText, 1977/1988). The visual and the visualized were pretty well treated among rhetorical critics as unproblematic, as non-oratorical texts, or simply celebrated by fans of McLuhan. Ah, the good old days. But, the 1970s and 1980s were witnessing revolutions in visual studies and my reading expanded.

[excerpt] Disciplines History | United States History This article is available at The Cupola: Scholarship at Gettysburg College: http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/histfac/1 5. \"FIENDS...FACING ZIONWARDS\": ABRAHAM LINCOLNS RELUCTANT EMBRACE OF THE ABOLITIONISTS It has always been one of the ironies of the era of the Civil War and the end of slavery in the United States that the man who played the role of Great Emancipator of the slaves was so hugely mistrusted and so energetically vilified by the party of abolition. Abraham Lincoln, whatever his larger reputation as the liberator of more than three million black slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation, has never entirely shaken off the reputation of being something of a half-heart about it. \"There is a counterlegend of Lincoln,\" acknowledged Stephen B. Oates, \"one shared ironically enough by many white Southerners and certain black Americans of our time\" who are convinced that Lincoln never intended to abolish slavery, \"was a bigot...a white racist who championed segregation, opposed civil and political rights for black people\" and \"wanted them all thrown out of the country.\" And a great deal of that reputation is still linked to the denunciations of Lincoln issued by virtually all of those who occupied the abolitionist vanguard, whether they be (as in Frederick Douglasss taxonomy) Garrisonians, Tappanites, Free Soilers, or even old Liberty Party men. It has been a large part of the task of Lincoln biographers ever since to deplore that image of Lincoln as the sort of extremist rhetoric that abolitionism was pretty generally renowned for; or to insist that Lincoln may have had elements of racism in him but gradually effaced them as he moved on his \"journey\" to emancipation; or to suggest that Lincoln was all along an abolitionist but dragged his feet over emancipation out of pragmatic political considerations. Josiah Gilbert Holland, whose Life of Abraham Lincoln was the first full-dress Lincoln biography in 1866, ridiculed the way in which \"Mr. Lincoln has been assailed...for being too slow\" to emancipate the 5-FIENDS...FACING ZIONWARDS 134 slaves.\" Holland believed that Lincoln certainly \"saw the time of emancipation coming,\" but he \"felt himself still withheld from meddling with slavery by any sweeping measure\" until 1862 because of his respect for the Constitution and his unwillingness to precipitate the border slave states into secession. Isaac Arnold, a one-time Democrat but strong anti-slavery ally of Lincolns in the Civil War Congress, upped the ante of justification by insisting that \"Lincoln in his younger days dreamed of being an emancipator\" and \"had always wished to emancipate the negroes,\" but wished the change to come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything.\" And even much more recently, Michael Burlingame sees Lincolns \"core\" value as \"a deep hatred of slavery\" and believes that \"Lincoln was hardly a reluctant emancipator.\" David Donald re-assuringly observes that \"Lincolns views on slavery were not, in fact, so far from those of his critics\"; the only reason why he did not join those critics earlier as an abolitionist activist was \"because he had so little personal knowledge of slavery.\" LaWanda Cox, Lincolns most vigorous academic justifier, writes that there is actually \"something breathtaking in his advance from prewar advocacy of restricting slaverys spread to foremost responsibility for slaverys total, immediate, uncompensated destruction by constitutional amendment.\" It is only because \"the constraints under which Lincoln felt he must labor were not always recognized by antislavery men,\" that Lincoln, then and now, has been charged with \"irresolute policy and wavering commitment.\" Still, not even the most vigorous apologists for Lincoln can entirely escape the sense of distance, no matter how varying they estimate its distance, between the Emancipator and the abolitionists. Indeed, they underestimate it, for the differences the abolitionists saw between themselves and Lincoln were not illusory or mere matters of timing and policy. They involved 5-FIENDS...FACING ZIONWARDS 135 not only the aggrievement of the righteous, but also the irritation of Lincoln himself; and not only quarrels over timetable and voting rights, but unbridgeable cultural issues. And only when those differences are allowed their full play can we begin to recognize how deeply Lincolns place in the story of slaverys end upsets some of the most recent, broad theoretical constructions of the anti-slavery movement, and how much it questions the moral and political assumptions of American reform, which have always drawn strength from the abolitionist example, rather than Lincoln‚Äôs, ever since. That the abolitionists disliked Lincoln almost unanimously cannot be in much doubt. They themselves said it too often, beginning as early as the mid-1850s, when Illinois abolitionists looked at Lincoln with a measure of suspicion as a recruit to the anti-slavery cause. Chicago newspaper editor Charles H. Ray told Elihu Washburne in December, 1855, that Lincoln would probably be a highly unreliable ally of the new Republican party. \"I must confess I am afraid of Abe\" because \"he is Southern by birth, Southern in his associations and southern, if I mistake not, in his sympathies.\" Besides, \"his wife\" -Mary Todd Lincoln -\"is a Todd, of a pro-slavery family, and so are all his kin.\" And the suspicions only became deeper from the moment he stepped into the national spotlight as the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1860. Charles Grandison Finney, the New School revivalist and president of the nations abolitionist hotbed, Oberlin College, scored Lincoln in the first issue of the Oberlin Evangelist to appear after the nominating convention: The Republican Convention at Chicago have put in nomination for President 5-FIENDS...FACING ZIONWARDS 136 Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, a gentleman who became widely known a year and a half ago by his political footrace against S.A. Douglas for the place of United States Senate from their state. In that campaign he won laurels on the score of his intellectual ability and forensic powers; but if our recollection is not at fault, his ground on the score of humanity towards the oppressed race was too low. In the eyes of black abolitionist Hezekiah Ford Douglass, Lincoln was no significant improvement on Stephen A. Douglas during the famous Lincoln-Douglas senatorial campaign in 1858; and Lincolns stature suffered no improvement for Douglass during the 1860 presidential campaign. \"We have four parties in this country that have marshalled themselves on the highway of American politics, asking for the votes of the American people,\" Douglass wrote, but \"so far as the principles of freedom and the hopes of the black man are concerned, all these parties are barren and unfruitful; neither of them seeks to lift the negro out of his fetters, and rescue this day from odium and disgrace.\" Lincoln, in particular, was no different from any of the opposition. I do not believe in the anti-slavery of Abraham Lincoln, because he is on the side of this Slave Power of which I am speaking, that has possession of the Federal Government. ...Now, two years ago, I went through the State of Illinois for the purpose of getting signers to a petition, asking the Legislature to repeal the Testimony Law, so as to permit colored men to testify against white men. I went to prominent Republicans, and among others, to Abrah', '2000', 6, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+douglas+went+stephen+public&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 34),
('oct+douglas+went+stephen+public', 9, 'Mad minister disease?', 'B. Dixon', 'Nearly ten years ago, a hitherto unknown neurological condition, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), appeared in British cows. It was labelled ‚Äòmad cow disease‚Äô, because of the strange combination of fear and shambling gait shown by its victims. As more cases came to light, BSE was found to be similar to scrapie in sheep and it was suggested that cows were infected by eating feedstuffs containing protein from sheep with scrapie. There was also concern about a human condition akin to scrapie: Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease (CJD). Although CJD encephalopathy is rare, the number of reported cases has been increasing (possibly because of improved diagnosis). Could CJD be caused by the agent of BSE, crossing the species barrier from cows to humans? Is beef safe to eat?These questions have resurfaced many times in Britain, and elsewhere too ‚Äî especially in Germany, which sought to ban UK beef imports in 1990. Meanwhile, the conundrum of BSE and its relationship with CJD has become even more complex. The media have sometimes been blamed for heightening the confusion, but a dispassionate analysis of their coverage shows that they have, for the most part, handled an unusually challenging subject rather well. Certain politicians emerge with considerably less credit for their contributions to public understanding and debate.The UK government took three early measures to combat BSE. It proscribed the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants, including cattle and sheep; established a programme to slaughter cattle suspected of having the disease; and banned the use in human food of any tissues (such as brain and spinal cord) that might contain the BSE agent. These were prudent precautions which almost certainly explain why the number of cases of BSE, having risen from 12 in 1986 to 36 924 in 1992, fell to 22 699 in 1994 and around 13 000 in 1995.The governments actions also engendered public confidence. But that was harmed when Food and Agriculture Minister John Gummer appeared on television in May 1990, trying to force his young daughter (who refused) to eat a beefburger. The spectacle was risible and widely ridiculed. Around this time, some experts expressed concern that the media were unhelpful in reporting allegations by other scientists that official efforts to limit the BSE problem were inadequate. One argument was that not only bovine spinal cord but also the vertebral column should be removed from human food. This was indeed later considered necessary: it is precisely what Gummers successor, Douglas Hogg, announced when he tightened BSE controls in December 1995.More generally, the UK media have been criticized for exaggerating the risk that CJD in humans is linked to BSE in cattle. In fact, most have reflected the honest professional disagreements that exist among virologists regarding this danger and the likelihood that each condition is caused by a protein particle termed a prion, and perhaps by the same prion. Several newspapers have devoted unusually large amounts of space to explain the nature of, and deficiencies in, the evidence.One example arose last October, when The Lancet published accounts of two British teenagers who had developed CJD. Because only four cases had been reported previously in this age group, the authors discussed a conjectural link with BSE. Their speculations could have attracted sensational headlines, but they did not. The lay media mostly covered the cases accurately and responsibly. Some went further, exploring the inherently complex issue of how researchers seek to establish a causal link between coincident phenomena, especially when dealing with infectious diseases with very long incubation times.There has also been considerable media coverage of the problem of discerning, from the decline in BSE following the governments control measures, whether those actions have been adequate and the disease can be expected to disappear completely. When the British Medical Journal, last November, printed seven partially contradictory expert opinions on the relationship of CJD to BSE, these too were fairly mirrored in press coverage.Criticism of the media for misrepresenting scientific developments is sometimes justified. On other occasions, complainants should consider whether their grievance is really against journalists or against claims and ideas, accurately reported, with which they disagree. In the case of UK coverage of BSE, the media in general have done a fine job. Faced with the alarming possibility of a nationwide epidemic of a distressing and potentially fatal brain disease among beef eaters, reporters have behaved responsibly and with restraint. The vast majority have covered a complex, ever-changing story competently, and have handled the uncertainties with commendable prudence.And the politicians? They are still behaving with disarming simplicity. Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, for example, speaking shortly after the BMJs explicit demonstration of expert disagreements last November, stated that there was ‚Äòno conceivable risk‚Äô of BSE being transmitted from cows to people. This was not what the real experts ‚Äî even the governments own advisors ‚Äî were saying. It was a feckless remark, made doubly conspicuous by the careful manner in which the media (on this occasion) have handled a biomedical scenario with enormous social implications.', '1996', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oct+douglas+went+stephen+public&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 34),

The 777 has been exclusively designed using CAD technology (with CATIA version 3), being the first airplane designed without building test structures before. Verification of joints and construction techniques has also been done digitally, with all the structures built up being included in the actual aircraft. The aircraft was designed to serve as an immediately superior Boeing 767 model and was built in airline consultancy (United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, ANA, British Airways, JAL, Qantas and Cathay Pacific) came from United Airlines in 1990 and the first flight took place on June 14, 1994, at the Boeing factory in Everett, near Seattle. It was the first ETOPS 180 bimonthly aircraft (it can fly up to 180 min from any airport able to take it). It is one of the best-selling (two-color) passenger airplanes in history, of which 988 were ordered, of which 635 were already delivered to the airlines. Its main competitors are Airbus A330 (for medium distance routes), Airbus A340 (for long-distance routes, with the claim that this model has the disadvantage of having four engines) and the future of the Airbus A350XWB-1000.

The aviation industry appears to lack a standardized, practical, and easily replicable protocol for fatigue risk assessment which can be consistently applied across operators. Aim Our paper sought to present a framework, supported by real-world data with subjective and objective parameters, to monitor aircrew fatigue and performance, and to determine the safe crew configuration for commercial airline operations. Methods Our protocol identified risk factors for fatigue-induced performance degradation as triggers for fatigue risk and performance assessment. Using both subjective and objective measurements of sleep, fatigue, and performance in the form of instruments such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check, Psychomotor Vigilance Task, sleep logs, and a wearable actigraph for sleep log correlation and sleep duration and quality charting, a workflow flagging fatigue-prone flight operations for risk mitigation was developed and trialed. Results In an operational study aimed at occupational assessment of fatigue and performance in airline pilots on a three-men crew versus a four-men crew for a long-haul flight, we affirmed the technical feasibility of our proposed framework and approach, the validity of the battery of assessment instruments, and the meaningful interpretation of fatigue and work performance indicators to enable the formulation of safe work recommendations.

However, scientific studies on the relationship between aviation and design and its different elements‚Äîcriticism, historiography, and culture‚Äîhave been scarce around the world, and non-existent in Portugal.1 The study we have carried out allowed us to clarify the nature of the relationship between the profile of a company that represented the country (and helped to spread an image of modernity) and the different areas of design. The pronounced ideological conditioning, which is present visually in design projects produced for Transportes Aereos Portugueses (TAP), from the first years of its existence, emerged as the result of its status as flag carrier. The logos, the crew‚Äôs uniforms, the different types of communication media, and the planes‚Äô interior design created a country that only existed ‚Äúin the air.‚Äù In the real country, obliged to remain underdeveloped, poor, and rural, the ‚Äúone way‚Äù ideology did not create job opportunities for designers outside the confines of what the regime understood to be official taste and expression‚Äîthat is, following the historicist and grandiloquent Portuguese way.2 The political closure of the 1950s‚Äîa time which, metaphorically speaking, we paint in black & white‚Äîmade way for a slow and progressive opening.

The close links between the rhetoric of the regime for external use and the TAP corporate image make for an unrivalled case study in the historiography of design in Portugal. 1 See Alexander von Vegesack and Jochen Eisenbrand, Airworld: Design and Architecture for Air Travel, 2 ed.

Pompeo', 'Low-cost airlines are all the rage in Europe. With rock-bottom fares that entice travelers from the chillier north to places like Barcelona, Nice, and Rome, such carriers have introduced Europeans to a cheap, fast mode of transport--a tangible benefit to consumers in the fitful march toward deregulation. As bookings pour in, the low-fare carriers are making ambitious expansion plans and placing large orders for new planes. Some are even earning profits that defy the cyclical nature of the airline business. Long-protected national-flag carriers are beginning to respond to the low-cost airlines, and capital markets are paying close attention to their business strategies, which many believe foretell the future of intra-European air travel. It is easy to see why. In 2001, while most traditional players reported losses and some succumbed to the competition, Europes leading low-cost carriers were more than merely profitable: Ryanair and easy Jet boasted operating margins of 26 and 9.5 percent, respectively--results that traditional airlines only dream about. In June 2002, Ryanair had a market capitalization of [euro]4.9 billion ($4.82 billion), 45 percent more than that of British Airways (BA), which has revenues that are 20 times larger. Expectations are high among some financial analysts, investors, and industry experts that the low-cost airlines, which now hold only 7 percent of the intra-European air travel market as reckoned by the number of passengers they fly and less by revenue, can reach the penetration levels achieved by their US counterparts (Exhibit 1). Since Southwest Airlines pioneered its low-cost strategy, 30 years ago, no-frills operators in the United States have captured a 25 percent share of the passengers in domestic air travel and a 15 percent share of the revenues. We doubt that Europes low-cost carriers can do equally well. As they expand full throttle from a predominantly UK base, they could indeed double their European market share in the next five years. But they are unlikely either to dominate short-haul travel in Europe or to approach the market share enjoyed by their US cousins. More likely, their longer-term growth will bump up against the ceiling of a European market in which the contestable low-cost segment is smaller than it is in the United States and well-established packaged-tour operators and national-flag carriers can block deeper inroads into the leisure- and business-travel segments. Europes business market is more limited, too: fewer routes have enough traffic to sustain the frequency of low-cost departures that could attract business passengers. These considerations should limit scheduled low-cost airlines to a successful niche strategy, mainly on routes to and from the United Kingdom and possibly to and from a few other Northern European countries. Interlopers in the skies Before European air travel was deregulated, in the mid-1990s, the market was neatly divided. Scheduled carriers, focusing primarily on business travelers, controlled 75 percent of the intra-European market. Charter airlines held the remaining 25 percent by selling aircraft capacity to tour operators and shuttling sun-seeking package tourists from cold Northern European countries to the beaches of Southern Europe. Both scheduled and charter incumbents were shaken by the emergence of low-cost carriers that targeted leisure and, to a lesser extent, business markets. Low-cost airlines rely on a simple business design: one kind of aircraft, one class of passenger, and more seats crammed into the airplane--as well as no airport lounges, no choice of seats, no newspapers, no food, no frequent-flyer programs, no connecting flights, no refunds, and no possibility of rebooking to other airlines. Also, there are no travel agents and expensive computer reservation systems; about 90 percent of easyjet and Ryanair tickets are booked over the Internet. ‚Ä¶', '2002', 28, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=flag+flags+southwest+pilots+figures+airlines+airline&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 35),

Winter', 'In December 2013, the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands, the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (KLM) approached the TU Delft with an outline for a graduation project. KLM set out the goal to develop an intuitive crew application for their pilots and cabin attendants to fulfill all their non-operational information needs. Furthermore, their aim was to improve interpersonal relationships within a crew with the ultimate goal of creating an engaged and attached KLM flying crew. The thesis is the result of the MSc graduation project, produced in affiliation with the Design for Interaction MsC program at Delft University of Technology and the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (KLM). THE PROJECT In June 2013, KLM, the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands, began issuing iPads to around 5,000 pilots, senior pursers and pursers (KLM Official Website, 2014). The tablet computer supports the flight personnel‚Äôs activities on board and introduces many valuable opportunities to improve the working context of the flying crew. Currently, most of the non-operational information is spread through a great variety of channels, resulting in important information not reaching its intended audience. Therefore, KLM decided to digitize, prioritize and bundle all relevant information into one intuitive crew application. The main goal of the project is to define the needs and wishes from the two main stakeholder groups: the flying crew, and the KLM business. Additionally, these insights need to be combined into one intuitive iPad application in a way that satisfies the involved parties. RESEARCH The foundation of the project was laid during the deconstruction phase. During this phase, relevant literature was studied (including, but not limited to literature on information overload, social design, acceptance of technology and the social identity theory). This literature provided the author with an understanding of the relevant domains and clear guidance for the continuation of the project. Additionally, user research (interviews, observations and context mapping) provided many insights into the world of the flying crew: what are their goals, motivations, needs and behaviors? Several aspects became abundantly clear during the research phase: - The most important thing to a crew member is their schedule: this determines how they fill in their free time and influences their whole personal life. - Traveling can get lonely at times, which is why the crew greatly values social interactions within a crew. Going on a trip, having dinner together, exchanging stories and pictures: all examples of aspects that are deemed as very important. - Exploring a new location is very important to a crew member: the crew is always curious about a new location and the activities that are waiting for them there. This exploration often already starts at home. - For KLM, it is difficult to connect with the flying crew, as they are barely present at Schiphol Airport. Due to this, KLM is having difficulties connecting with their employees and set out a goal to create a more connected and engaged crew. MY PERSONAL PAGE All the needs and wishes established during the research phase were translated into three concepts, which, after several evaluations with the stakeholders, combined into one final concept: The Personal Page application (presented on the right). With the Personal Page application, a pilot or cabin attendant has all non-operational information at hand at the moment he/she needs it. The tool contains several elements to improve one‚Äôs complete flight process: - An up-to-date schedule: thanks to the monthly overview the user can easily see all upcoming flights, trainings and other activities. - An explorative flight overview: the user is able to browse through an upcoming journey as if experiencing it at that moment, receiving all potentially relevant information. - Sharing activities: a big database filled with personal tips and tricks about specific locations bonds the crew and provides the user with many valuable location insights. Additionally, the Personal Page application allows the user to suggest activities to the rest of the crew, lowering the threshold for the establishment of a close crew relationship. - KLM news and magazines: a strong wish from the KLM communication department is to create a connected and well-informed crew: a first step in achieving this is by ensuring the crew receives all (personally relevant) KLM updates. EVALUATION In order to assess the usability and user experience of the Personal Page application, an interactive prototype was created and tested with the stakeholders. This prototype can be accessed via www.mypersonalpage.estherdewinter.com. Evaluations with five target users indicated that the Personal Page application has great potential to become a success. All participants expressed enthusiasm about the design and usability of the Personal Page application and conveyed an interest in downloading the application from the KLM application store. Additionally, the usability study results suggested several points for improvement. Several icons and terms used throughout the application caused confusion, resulting in a lack of flow. Furthermore, while the Personal Page application has great potential for improving interpersonal crew relationships, it is important to dedicate further work into creating a stronger relationship between the KLM and the crew. It is recommended to delve deeper into literature on social identities to accomplish this. CONCLUSION Overall, it can be concluded that the assignment to create an interactive crew application has been successfully completed. Valuable insights into the needs and wishes of the flying crew have been established and combined with the demands from the KLM business. Hopefully, these insights will direct KLM towards a future with a (more) connected and engaged flying crew.', '2014', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=flag+flags+southwest+pilots+figures+airlines+airline&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 35);

Patience', '\n The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions and attitudes of South Carolina independent full-service restaurant operators in relation to the operational and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study utilized a mixed-methods approach that first partnered with local administrative and governmental bodies to disseminate a short survey. The survey was open to respondents for a 5-week period, beginning May 4th, 2020, which was when restaurants were permitted to reopen indoor dining, but with seating capacity restrictions to ensure social distancing. The second qualitative stage employed semi-structured post-survey interviews with selected independent restaurant operators from across the state. The results indicated that 25% of the restaurants polled did not survive the nearly two-month closure. Less than a quarter of respondents were unable to bring back their company‚Äôs employees to pre-pandemic levels. The CARES Act financial relief programs were favored by most (81%) of the surveyed restaurant operators. Approximately 65% of the respondents did not feel they could keep their restaurants open if the pandemic restrictions remained in place until 2021. The respondents were split as to the future viability of the hospitality and tourism industry. The study offers guidance and managerial strategies for other independent full-service restaurant operators, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\n', '2020', 13, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=restaurants+restaurant+employees+canes+corporate+pandemic&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 36),

The proposed research framework was tested using data from 226 customers of casual dining restaurants who responded to a questionnaire-based survey that was administered in northern Taiwan. The results indicate that employee service sabotage is positively related to customer deviant behaviors and potentially increases the incidence of the latter. Moreover, the relationship between employee service sabotage and customer deviant behaviors is mediated by relational quality, including satisfaction and commitment. It was found that the relationship between employee service sabotage and customer deviant behaviors is negatively moderated by corporate reputation.

We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%).

Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62).

Toyoda, Ruan Zhang', 'Our understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOCs) has been primarily acquired through analysis of Spike-specific IgG responses. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the breadth and longevity of immune responses after infection and vaccination requires analysis of cellular immunity. Herein, we report on T cell immunity in infected and vaccinated individuals, identifying CD4+/CD8+ T cell cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2 and variant peptides (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Delta, B.1.617.2). Our results demonstrate that T cells in infected or vaccinated individuals can elicit robust and cross-reactive immune responses against VOCs. This information could be helpful in understanding the composition and durability of human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs. The limited efficacy of most treatments and high death rates associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have led to a focus on vaccines as the last best hope for stemming the pandemic. However, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2, driven primarily by VOCs, has raised concerns regarding our ability to induce durable immunity through vaccination [1]. Early observations have raised concerns regarding the rapid and unpredictable dissipation of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and the potential effect on long-term immunity [2, 3]. In addition, reports have shown that IgG spike protein-specific immune responses induced by the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine may have reduced activity against the Alpha variant [4]. The recent emergence of the Delta variant has reinvigorated concerns about the protective immunity provided by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines since disturbing reports of vaccine breakthrough infections have been published [5]. Spike-specific IgG receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies are evanescent and do not reflect important memory components. Thus, additional analysis of CD4+/CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides and VOCs [6] could broaden our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. The emerging Delta variant is characterized by multiple mutations in the spike protein including T19R, Œî157‚Äì158, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N. It is likely that these mutations affect immune responses to important antigenic regions of the receptor-binding domain. In addition, strains with the P681R mutation have accelerated replication, increasing infectivity. Data on the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2vaccines against the Delta variant are limited [7]. We developed a whole-blood assay to detect SARS-CoV-2specific T cells. Analysis of cytokine production in stimulated T cells confirmed that IL-2 and TNF-Œ± are consistent markers for activated CD4+ T cells, while activated CD8+ T cells mainly produce TNF-Œ± and IFN-Œ≥. After incubating whole blood with a SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide pool, we were able to identify Spikereactive T cells by dual-cytokine gating (Supplementary Fig. S1). In this assay, healthy individuals with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated no significant T cell response to the SARSCoV-2 spike peptide. However, T cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected or vaccinated individuals showed substantial spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Next, we examined memory T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in 134 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). T cell immune responses to peptide pools of 5 major SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Spike, VME, NCAP, AP3A, and NS7A) were analyzed. For healthy control individuals, no significant CD4+ T cell responses to the 5 SARSCoV-2 proteins were seen (Fig. 1A, IL-2+/TNF-Œ±+ (%) in CD4+ <0.05%, mean= 0.01%). However, 20% of healthy individuals showed heterogeneous TNF-Œ±+/IFN-Œ≥+CD8+ T cell (>0.05%) responses to the 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which could represent cross-reactivity among CD8+ T cells generated during previous endemic coronavirus infection (Fig. 1B) [8]. Based on the background level of the CD4+ T cell response in healthy controls, we set 0.05% dual-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as the cutoff level for identifying positive T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we observed that 88% (30 of 34) of infected patients had either positive CD4+ or CD8+ T cell immunity to one or more of the 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Most patients showed positive CD4+ T cell immunity (85%, 29 of 34), and CD4+ T cells demonstrated immunodominant responses to Spike peptides, as previously described [8] (Fig. 1A). CD8+ T cells showed similar responses to the 5 proteins. Next, we analyzed Spike-specific CD4+/CD8+ immune responses induced by the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine.

We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. Results: Of the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. Conclusions: We found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.', '2021', 5, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=vaccines+vaccinations+vaccinated+covidvaccine+delta+peters+reports+reported&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 37),

Whether excess mortality has occurred during the Delta wave is less well understood. Methods: We performed an observational study using data from the Massachusetts Department of Health. Five years of US Census population data and CDC mortality statistics were applied to a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) model to project the number of expected deaths for each week of the pandemic period, including the Delta period (starting in June 2021, extending through August 28th 2021, for which mortality data are >99% complete).

Infection despite full vaccination (vaccine breakthrough) has been reported, but characteristics of those with vaccine breakthrough resulting in hospitalization and relative rates of hospitalization in unvaccinated and vaccinated persons are not well described, including during late June and July 2021 when the highly transmissible Delta variant predominated. Methods: From January 1-June 30, 2021, cases defined as adults aged [‚â•]18 years with laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were identified from >250 acute care hospitals in the population-based COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Through chart review for sampled cases, we examine characteristics associated with vaccination breakthrough. From January 24-July 24, 2021, state immunization information system data linked to both >37,000 cases representative cases and the defined surveillance catchment area population were used to compare weekly hospitalization rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Unweighted case counts and weighted percentages are presented. Results: From January 1 - June 30, 2021, fully vaccinated cases increased from 1 (0.01%) to 321 (16.1%) per month. Among 4,732 sampled cases, fully vaccinated persons admitted with COVID-19 were older compared with unvaccinated persons (median age 73 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) 65-80] v. 59 years [IQR 48-70]; p<0.001), more likely to have 3 or more underlying medical conditions (201 (70.8%) v. 2,305 (56.1%), respectively; p<0.001) and be residents of long-term care facilities [37 (14.5%) v. 146 (5.5%), respectively; p<0.001]. From January 24 - July 24, 2021, cumulative hospitalization rates were 17 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons (423 cases per 100,000 population v. 26 per 100,000 population, respectively); rate ratios were 23, 22 and 13 for those aged 18-49, 50-64, and [‚â•]65 years respectively. For June 27 - July 24, hospitalization rates were [‚â•]10 times higher in unvaccinated persons compared with vaccinated persons for all age groups across all weeks.

Alqahtani, Sujoy Bhattacharyya, A. Alawadi, Hamad Al Mahmeed, Jaleela Al Sayed, J. Justman, W. El-Sadr, J. Hidary, Siddhartha Mukherjee', '\n The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants across the world has raised concerns about the effectiveness of available COVID-19 vaccines that were designed against the original Wuhan (wild type) variant. Critical questions have arisen regarding: (a) the effectiveness of various vaccines in preventing infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death and (b) the magnitude and clinical consequences of post-vaccination infections in the context of emerging variants, especially the Delta variant of SARS-Cov2. While ‚Äúreal world‚Äù experiences with various vaccines have been reported, few have examined comparative effectiveness of various vaccines in one population, as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged. Here we present an analysis of COVID-19 related outcomes from Bahrain, a country with a total population of 1.501 million, where four vaccines were deployed (total vaccinated =1,003,960), including Astra-Zeneca (AZ/Covishield), Pfizer/BioNtech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. By analyzing individual histories of vaccinated versus unvaccinated cases, we provide a granular description of the effectiveness of the four vaccines, disease burden in unvaccinated versus vaccinated individuals over time, and the risk of four outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths) due to breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals. We conclude that the four vaccines were effective in reducing all four outcomes in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated individuals, prior to, and during the period when the Delta variant became dominant in the country (May 2021 to the present). However, after censoring early vaccine recipients of Sinopharm vaccine, compared to Pfizer/BionTech recipients, individuals vaccinated with Sinopharm had a higher risk of post-vaccination infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths, especially in those > 50 years old. Our overall findings support the value of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 related events even with the advent of the Delta variant. These data support the urgent need to expand vaccination access around the world, and may serve to guide the choice of vaccines in the context of the Delta variant.', '2021', 2, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=vaccines+vaccinations+vaccinated+covidvaccine+delta+peters+reports+reported&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 37),

Hoque, M. M. Rahman, A. Das', 'Background While Bangladesh has started its mass COVID-19 vaccination drive, it is struggling to cover its huge population similar to other low- and middle-income countries due to the lack of vaccine availability. One of the major remittance sources for Bangladesh is its migrant workers who are required to receive mRNA vaccines to return to their jobs. Despite reports of higher efficacy of mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, breakthrough infection cases are arising especially with the emergence of Delta variant. It is highly important to understand the post-vaccination immune response and breakthrough infections in different populations so that the necessity of booster dosage can be assessed properly. Methods We observed post BNT162b2 full vaccination immune response in a small older group (mean age= 59.5+-5.44 years) of migrant workers (n=10) for six months at the Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The plasma samples from the participants were collected after 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and 6 months of receiving the 2nd dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Anti S1 RBD IgG responses were measured as optical density ratios using a commercially available ELISA kit. Results All 10 of the participants were male migrant workers and none of them had a history of previous COVID-19 infection. The median antibody response [IQ1:IQ3] was 9.05 [7.53; 10.0] on day 14 then it increases to 13.6 [12.0; 14.0] at the second month which gradually decreased to a median of 8.63 [8.34; 9.37] on the 6th-month post-vaccination. There were two breakthrough infection cases after receiving the second dose and the antibody responses were highly increased in the following months. Two of the breakthrough cases were diagnosed with mild COVID-19 as the symptom duration was less than 3 days with no respiratory complications and no hospital admission were required. Conclusions The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine produces a strong immune response that sustains at least 6 months after getting fully vaccinated. But even after getting fully vaccinated people are susceptible to breakthrough infections that are not severe and boost the immune response greatly offering a hybrid immunity from both vaccine and natural infection. Hence, it is still important to fully vaccinate a greater number of people rather than thinking of offering booster dosage to the privileged populations out of the fear of breakthrough cases. If the LMICs can quickly cover at least 80% of their population with usual priority targets (healthcare workers, migrant workers, older people, etc.) then a global risk reduction and pandemic control would be possible that will allow additional variant-specific boosters for targeted populations if evidence support.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=vaccines+vaccinations+vaccinated+covidvaccine+delta+peters+reports+reported&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 37),

Parents reported being nervous about the newness of the vaccine and how fast it was developed, as well as the potential for side effects and allergic reactions. Additionally, parents of adolescents raised concerns about the vaccine affecting puberty and future fertility.

Graffin', 'Introduction Electronic mail is becoming the most widely used form of communication today, but is limited in terms of communicating with respect to emotion in particular. The biggest problems in electronic mail are misinterpretation of e-mails and lack of ability to express oneself. Electronic communication, because of its speed and broadcasting ability, is obviously different from paper-based communication such as letters. Because the exchange of messages can be so fast, e-mail is more conversational than traditional letters. For instance, in a letter, it can be important to make everything completely clear because the other person may not have a chance to ask questions, or their native language might not be the same. However, with email, others can ask questions immediately therefore email akin to conversational speech, is not as formal and neat as communications via posted letter (Sherwood, 2007). Some commentators have also mentioned that with the accelerated pace of life at present, email seems the perfect medium for a hectic day. In other words, simply get that idea down and shoot it out and obviously little of this encourages a thoughtful revision prior to hitting send (Goleman, 2007). For many centuries, letter-writing was a high literary form where ordinary people put great thought into their words, and laboured over style. This seemed part of the process and ensured that a letter was worth sending before posting. We can see this through the numerous volumes of ‚ÄúCollected Letters of...‚Äù, from Abe Lincoln to Teresa of Avila. It is doubtful as to whether there will ever be such volumes of collected e-mails (Goleman, 2007). Interestingly, there are a number of online services which translate email into snail mail for a fee. One example is NetGrams E-mail Bridge which is an automated, web and email based system providing convenience for users wishing to send hard copy communications to people who do not have email. This however does not overcome the aforementioned problems of email communication. There is also the problem of SPAM. This research is not directed at the problem of SPAM suffice to say that the unceasing arrivals of unsolicited email hardens us to emails from non-spamming individuals making requests for information (Filman, 2003; Deepak & Parameswaran, 2005; Gburzynski & Maitan, 2004). This can be a problem if one is seeking important information for whatever reason from a third party. (Daft and Lengel, 1986) advanced the notion that communication richness (or leanness) is an invariant, objective property of communication media. They argue that individuals would choose media higher in richness for those managerial tasks higher in equivocality or ambiguity. They state ‚Äúinformation richness is defined as the ability of information to change understanding within a time interval. Communication transactions that can clarify ambiguous issues to change understanding in a timely manner are considered rich. Communications that require a long time to enable understanding or that cannot overcome different perspectives are lower in richness......Communication media vary in the capacity to process rich information.... In order of decreasing richness, the media classifications are (1) face-to-face, (2) telephone, (3) personal documents such as letters or memos, (4) impersonal written documents, and (5) numeric documents. The reason for richness differences include the mediums capacity for immediate feedback, the number of cues and channels utilized, personalization, and language variety.... Face-to-face is the richest medium because it provides immediate feedback so that interpretation can be checked. Media of low richness process fewer cues and restrict feedback, and are less appropriate for resolving equivocal issues. However, an important point is that media of low richness are effective for processing well understood messages and standard data (Daft and Lengel, 1986), (Ngwenyama and Lee, 1997). (Carlson and Zmud, 1994) put forward the \"channel expansion theory\" which rejects the idea that communication richness is an invariant, objective property of the communication medium itself, independent of the social context where the communication takes place. (Lee, 1994) provides an account of how richness occurs in communication that uses electronic mail', '2011', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=blood+email+account+nbsp+posting+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 38);

Afshari', 'An unsteady compressible multiphase flow solver is developed and used to simulate shock-bubble interaction in a non-Newtonian fluid. A five-equation multiphase model that accounts for capillary and viscous effects is employed and discretized by finite volume methodology. Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver is invoked to compute the convective fluxes and Tangent of Hyperbola for Interface Capturing (THINC) interface sharpening scheme is applied to reduce the excessive diffusion at the interface. Multiple benchmark problems such as Air-Helium Shock Tube, shock cavity interaction, Rayleigh-Taylor instability and underwater explosion are probed to evaluate the performance and accuracy of this method. The results obtained compare well with the available experimental and numerical data. The developed solver is then used to study shock-interface interaction in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian mediums. Non-Newtonian liquid is resembling the blood modeled by Carreau-Yasuda constitutive equation. The obtained results show an expedition of bubble-collapse with a higher jet tip velocity in nonNewtonian medium compared to that in the Newtonian surrounding liquid. Moreover, a third phase adjacent to the bubble collapse is considered and the penetration depth of the re-entrant jet in the neighboring phase is studied as a measure of tissue injury. Our results show that by increasing post shock pressure, the reentrant jet velocity and thus the penetration depth increases. Furthermore, increasing the adjacent phase viscosity results into less penetration depth in the tissue. ÔÄ™ Corresponding Author.

The recent use of inflammatory cytokines is pivotal and very useful in monitoring diabetic patients during sub-clinical transformation to a life threatening diabetic complication.8 Inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-4 and TNFŒ± are involved in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.9 IL-6 was initially thought to be a proinflammatory cytokine mainly with effects within the immune system, but this understanding of IL-6 was soon found to be too simplistic.10 In the adaptive and innate immune systems, IL-6 is involved in both amplification of and protection against inflammation.10 Thus, inappropriate regulation of IL-6 may play a direct protective or deleterious role in both antigen-specific immune-mediated diseases and in diseases where IL-6 or other inflammatory factors cause a low-grade inflammation (as seen in obesity and type 2 diabetes), which is likely to be involved in the pathogeneses of these diseases.10 IL-6 has been suggested to be involved in the development of obesity-related and T2DM-related insulin resistance.11 TNF-Œ± are pro-inflammatory cytokines whose expression increases chemotactic factors and adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium to effect the process of extravasation of leucocytes (especially neutrophils) in response to specific inflammatory stimulus such as bacterial infection.12 IL-6, in more recent studies in type 2 diabetic patients in India, was demonstrated to be a strong predictor of progression to diabetic complications which has been related to alterations in endothelial permeability, induction of messengial cell proliferation and increased fibronectin expression.12 Among various pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) has attracted the most attention, since it amplifies the inflammatory network of cytokines leading to a worsening progression of diabetes.13 In particular, it has been suggested that TNF-Œ± is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, given that TNF-Œ± down-regulates the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a centrally operating anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the innate immune system. It has strong deactivating properties on the inflammatory host response mediated by macrophages and lymphocytes, and potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-Œ±.14 IL-10 is produced by T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and macrophages, under tight genetic control. The key roles of IL-10 as an inhibitory cytokine of autoimmunity and inflammation raise questions concerning the impacts of this cytokine on the pathogenesis of other diseases including type 2 DM and its nephropathic complications.15 IL-6 concentration between diabetics and non-diabetics groups, but no significant difference was observed in TNF-Œ±, IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations between study groups (p>0.05). TNF-Œ± and IL-6 was significantly higher in diabetics with cardiovascular disorders compared to non-diabetics subjects with cardiovascular disorders (p<0.001). Conclusion.

Skiba', 'Can You Post a Nugget of Knowledge in 140 Characters or Less? AS YOU KNOW, I rely on many resources to write this column, including various blogs on technologies in higher education and my faithful resources from Educause. I am most interested in tools that facilitate communication, collaboration, social networking, and learning. In the communication area, digital immigrants pride themselves in using email, participating in asynchronous discussions, and sometimes even venturing into the world of online chats. But to digital natives, email in particular is so yesterday, or, as stated in the Chronicle of Higher Education, \"email is for old people\" (1). Digital natives tend to communicate in the moment using IM (instant messaging), text messaging, blogging, expressing themselves on social networking sites, and now sending tweets. NO, I DID NOT MAKE UP THE WORD. A tweet, a posting of 140 characters or less, is the mainstay of an online application called Twitter. This product, first introduced in 2006, is a communication tool aimed at digital natives. According to Educause Learning Initiative (2): \"Twitter is an online application that is part blog, part social networking site, part cell phone/IM tool....\" Wikipedia defines Twitter as \"a free social networking and microblogging service that allows users to send \"updates\" (or \"tweets\"; text-based posts...) to the Twitter website, via short message service, instant messaging, or a third-party application such as Twitterrific\" (3). Digital natives can meet the creator and hear about the idea behind micro-blogging in a video interview with Biz Stone (http://uk.intruders.tv/Interview-with-Twitter-co-founder-Biz-Stone_al33.html). Digital immigrants may prefer to read about micro-blogging and Twitter at the PBS Media Shift site (www.pbs.org/mediashift/2007/05/digging_deepertwitter_ founders.html). Just so you do not think I am crazy, the New York Times, the BBC, and Al Jazeera are all experimenting with Twitter, as are political figures John Edwards, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. So, if you want to communicate with and update a circle of your closest friends, family members, research colleagues, clinical preceptors, or students, then you might want to explore Twitter. But you must be succinct; 140 characters is not a lot of space. So How Does It Work? After setting up an account (http://twitter.com), establish a profile and determine if you want your tweets to be public (appear on a pubic timeline page) or protected (open only to people connected to your profile). You can invite people to your account. Then, as your \"friends\" connect, their tweets and yours will appear on your Twitter page. To do this, you can use the web or connect to your instant messaging account or mobile device (your phone or your PDA). How Is Twitter Used in Higher Education? A quick look at various higher education blogs indicates several ways to use Twitter with your students. One idea is to communicate with students about the great ideas - the nuggets of knowledge - we glean while attending conferences (2). (I like this idea as I often attend informatics conferences.) For example, I can send the entire class a quick note about speakers or talks they may want to visit later or tell them about specific ideas I got from a talk (that would also serve as a reminder to me after the conference). I also like the notion of using Twitter like instant messaging to tell students about an important change in plans (class is cancelled/there is a change in their practicum sites) or to communicate with a large group of colleagues, like preceptors, who may not have their email readily accessible while working. On the PBS teachers blog, there is a good example of how a teacher uses Twitter with middle school students to teach collaborative writing skills. Each student is limited to 140 characters or less and there can be only 140 posts to tell the story. The collaborative writing assignment is based on the Twittory framework (http:// twittories. ‚Ä¶', '2008', 65, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=blood+email+account+nbsp+posting+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 38),

Campbell', 'IN THE CHAPTER TITLED \"LA SOLEDAD LUMINOSA\" IN PABLO Nerudas posthumously published (1974) memoirs, Confieso que he vivido: Memorias, we have an account by the Chilean poet in which he sets out certain recollections about his time living in Asia. He first joined the Chilean foreign service in 1927 and was initially posted to Rangoon, Burma; he was then appointed to Colombo, in Ceylon, and his final Asian posting was in June 1930 to Batavia, now Jakarta, but then the administative and commercial capital of the Dutch East Indies.1 At one point in diat chapter Neruda writes:My new home in Batavia was on a street called Probolinggo. It had a living room, a bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom. I never owned a car, but it did have a garage that was always empty. I had more than enough space in this tiny house. I took on a Javanese cook, an old peasant woman, charming and egalitarian. A \"boy,\" also Javanese, served table and looked after my clothes. There I finished Residencia en ia tierra.[...]My solitude became even deeper. I decided to get married. I had met a creole- to be exact, a Dutch girl with a few drops of Malay blood- and I became very fond of her. She was a tall, gentle girl and knew nothing of the world of arts and letters. (Neruda, Memoirs 109).Nerudas arrival in the Indies from Colombo in June 1930 as Chilean Consul could hardly have been more inauspicious. He soon discovered mat his predecessor had never actually taken up duties, preferring to live in Paris all the while and leaving consular affairs to an honorary consul whom he had failed to reimburse! The new Consul first resided at die Hotel der Nederlanden, in the leafy Weltvreden district (now near Lapangen Banteng in present-day Jakarta). Characterized by Neruda as a period of despair and isolation, this period was only modestly productive for his (published) poetry of the period- two prose poems and three lyric pieces- with the poem, \"El deshabitado\" (\"The Uninhabited One\"), probably written in Batavia shortly after arrival (Moran 60; Neruda, Residencia 14). The general tropical gloom that pervades the surrealism of these poems of Nerudas Batavia period is evident, even if compared with earlier poems in his Residencia series, or with later poems also set in or drawing upon the experiences of his Asian sojourn.Neruda moved to the house in Jalan Probolinggo No 5- then known under Dutch nomenclature as Probolinggoweg 5- where he was still hopeful that his love from Chile, Albertina from Temuco, would join him. But that was not to be. In a letter sent from Weltvreden and dated 15 December 1930, he wrote to his father that he had married \"a woman of Dutch nationality who came from a distinguished family who settled in Java many years ago (Reyes, El Enigma 47-8). The woman was Maria Antonia Hagenaar Vogelzanz (born Djogjakarta, 1900; died Den Haag, 1965), whom he called, Manica (see Figure I).2 Indeed, Neruda had asked a Santiago writer friend to send the photo of his new bride and himself outside the house, to the Chilean popular journal, Zigzag (Loyola 2008: 496497).In April 2011, the present writer sought out the location of \"the house at Jalan Probolinggo\" to establish whether there were any traces or memorializing of the site in present-day Jakarta. It still is a relatively quiet street, a short turn-off from the major thoroughfare of Jalan Sutan Syahrir, which runs parallel to the nearby Dutch-built canal. Buildings are mainly located on southwestern side of the street as it abuts the area where the railway from Gambir station to central Java runs on an elevated platform. The busiest location seemed to be the local school, shaded as it was by the mature trees, with their descending runners that now tower over the roadwayWhen Neruda first lived at Jalan Probolinggo No 5, the road was a relatively new development near the Nieuw Gondangdia housing area in the southern section of Batavia, but which is now located in the central Jakarta administrative district of Menteng. ‚Ä¶', '2012', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=blood+email+account+nbsp+posting+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 38),

There are a large number of campaigns containing coordinated spam or promoting accounts in Twitter, which are more harmful than the traditional methods, such as email spamming. Since traditional solutions mainly check individual accounts or messages, it is an urgent task to detect spam and promoting campaigns in Twitter. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework to detect both spam and promoting campaigns. Our framework consists of three steps: firstly linking accounts who post URLs for similar purposes, secondly extracting candidate campaigns which may exist for spam or promoting purpose and finally distinguishing their intents. One salient aspect of the framework is introducing a URL-driven estimation method to measure the similarity between accounts purposes of posting URLs, the other one is proposing multiple features to distinguish the candidate campaigns based on a machine learning method. Over a large-scale dataset from Twitter, we can extract the actual campaigns with high precision and recall and distinguish the majority of the candidate campaigns correctly.', '2012', 92, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=blood+email+account+nbsp+posting+posted+posts+post&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 38),

Keywords: TGT, Media of guess Picture, motivation, learning outcomes. The improvement of the students‚Äô learning outcomes was influenced by one factor like the high motivation. The observation result at the fifth grade of SD. Inpres Galangan Kapal II Makassar, the students motivation was low. The teacher was as a center, the students felt difficult to understand so the students‚Äô motivation was still low. The solution of this case was the application of cooperative learning by using Team Game Tournament (TGT) model through guess picture to make the students understoodbecause the media of guess picture helped students to understand and to rememberabout the figures‚Äô picture. The researcher used Classroom Action Research (CAR) Kemmis & Mc Taggart which consisted of four stages like planning, action, observation and reflection. This research continued for two cycles, each cycle consisted of 4 meetings. The research instrument was observation sheets, questionnaires, and test results of study, field notes, interview and documentation. The findings showed that the application of cooperative learning by using Team Game Tournament (TGT) model through the media of guess picture increased the students motivation at the fifth grade of SD. Inpres Galangan Kapal II. The result can be seen from the improvement of the students‚Äô motivation where the first cycle was 70.8% to 81.3 %. The second cycle, the percentage was 10.5%. The students‚Äô result of social studies also increased from 56.7% pre-action, the first cycle reached 70.0%, the second cycle was 86.6%. The completeness of the students‚Äô classical learning from the first cycle to the second cycle was 16.6%. The result had achieved the criteria of an action that was ‚â• 85% of the students reached KKM 70 in the second cycle. The researcher concluded that the application of cooperative learning by using Team Game Tournament (TGT) through the media of guess picture increased the students‚Äô motivation and learning result of social studies at the fifth grade of SD.

Votroubek', 'Continuous games have compact strategy sets and continuous utility functions. Such games can have a highly complicated structure of Nash equilibria. Algorithms and numerical methods for the equilibrium computation are known only for particular classes of continuous games such as two-person polynomial games or games with pure equilibria. This contribution focuses on the computation and approximation of a mixed strategy equilibrium for the whole class of multiplayer general-sum continuous games. We extend vastly the scope of applicability of the double oracle algorithm, which was initially designed and proved to converge only for twoperson zero-sum games. Specifically, we propose an iterative strategy generation technique, which splits the original problem into the master problem with only a finite subset of strategies being considered, and the subproblem in which an oracle finds the best response of each player. This simple method is guaranteed to recover an approximate equilibrium in finitely many iterations. Further, we argue that the Wasserstein distance (the earth mover‚Äôs distance) is the right metric on the space of mixed strategies for our purposes. Our main result is the convergence of this algorithm in the Wasserstein distance to an equilibrium of the original continuous game. The numerical experiments show the performance of our method on several examples of games appearing in the literature. Introduction A strategic n-person game is called continuous if the action space of each player is a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space and all utility functions are continuous. Continuous games have equilibria in mixed strategies by Glicksberg‚Äôs generalization of the Nash‚Äôs theorem (Glicksberg 1952), but those equilibria are usually very hard to characterize and compute. Nevertheless, many real-world scenarios and application domains have a continuum of actions expressing the amount of time, resources, location in space (Kamra et al. 2018, 2019), or parameters of classifiers (Yasodharan and Loiseau 2019). Equilibria of some large imperfect information games can be found by an infinite approximation of the original game (Ganzfried and Sandholm 2010). We point out the main difficulties in the analysis and development of algorithms for continuous games. Copyright ¬© 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. ‚Ä¢ The equilibrium can be any tuple of mixed strategies with infinite supports (Karlin 1959) or almost any tuple of finitely-supported mixed strategies (Rehbeck 2018). ‚Ä¢ Bounds on the size of supports of equilibrium strategies are known only for particular classes of continuous games (Stein, Ozdaglar, and Parrilo 2008). ‚Ä¢ Some important games have only mixed equilibria; for example, certain variants of Colonel Blotto games (Golman and Page 2009). ‚Ä¢ Finding a mixed strategy equilibrium involves locating its support, which lies inside a continuum of points. To the best of our knowledge, algorithms or numerical methods exist only for very special classes of continuous games. In particular, two-person zero-sum polynomial games can be solved by the sum-of-squares optimization based on the sequence of semidefinite relaxations of the original problem (Parrilo 2006; Laraki and Lasserre 2012). The book (Ba≈üar and Olsder 1999) contains a detailed analysis of equilibria for some families of games with a particular shape of utility functions (games of timing, bell-shaped kernels, etc.) One of the principal learning methods for finite games, fictitious play (Robinson 1951; Brown 1951), was recently extended to continuous action spaces and applied to Blotto games (Ganzfried 2021). The dynamics of fictitious play were analyzed only under further restrictive assumptions in the continuous setting; see (Hofbauer and Sorin 2006; Perkins and Leslie 2014). No-regret learning studied in (Mertikopoulos and Zhou 2019) can be applied to finding pure equilibria or to mixed strategy learning in finite games. In a similar setting, Chasnov et al. (2020) provide convergence guarantees to a neighborhood of a stable Nash equilibrium for gradient-based learning algorithms. The double oracle algorithm of (McMahan, Gordon, and Blum 2003) was extended from finite games and proved to converge for all two-person zero-sum continuous games (Adam et al. 2021). The algorithm is relatively straightforward ‚Äî it is based on the iterative solution of finite subgames and the subsequent extension of the current strategy sets with best response strategies. Despite its simplicity, this method was successfully adapted to large extensive-form games (Bo≈°ansk√Ω et al. 2014), certain Bayesian games (Li and Wellman 2021), and real-world security domains with complex policy spaces (Xu et al. 2021a). ar X iv :2 10 9. 04 17 8v 1 [ cs .G T ] 9 S ep 2 02 1 In this contribution, we extend the double oracle algorithm beyond two-person zero-sum continuous games. Our main result, Theorem 1, guarantees that Algorithm 1 converges to an equilibrium for any general-sum n-player continuous game. Moreover, this convergence is naturally captured by the Wasserstein distance on the space of mixed strategies. We demonstrate the computational performance of our method on selected examples of games appearing in the literature.

Ooijen', 'The article focuses on the underlying structures evaluating acts of violence against different bodies in games. Taking the hunting mechanics of open-world games as its point of discussion, it looks at how game design manifests procedural arguments on the ideological aspects of animal violence. Whereas there are instances of explicit violence in these games, the article argues that the explicitness of such depictions serves to emphasize the ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù of producing animal goods, thus impeding the ‚Äúcarnist‚Äù ideological view of meat as pure commodity. By considering how games distinguish humans from animals, it looks at what violent acts are rendered acceptable or unacceptable, and notes distinctions between what bodies are protected by, or exempt from, moral and legal rights. Finally, the article considers how the algorithmic nature of spawning makes digital animals immune to extinction. Interestingly enough, the article nevertheless notices how a game may intentionally diverge from this logic in order to defamiliarize its established logic. Among the games discussed are Rockstar‚Äôs Red Dead Redemption (2010), and Ubisoft‚Äôs Assassin‚Äôs Creed III (2012) and Far Cry 3 (2012).

Kurangnya proses belajar mengajar dalam menggunakan metode, media dan strategi dapat mengakibatkan siswa kurang memiliki motivasi untuk belajar karena pembelajaran dianggap membosankan. Oleh karena itu tujuan penelitian ini adalah mendeskripsikan pemanfaatan model Teams Games Tournament untuk pembelajaran qira‚Äôah dilihat dari (1) proses pelaksanaan pembelajaran, (2) hasil belajar siswa, dan (3) peningkatan motivasi belajar siswa. Subjek penelitian tindakan kelas (PTK) dengan dua siklus ini adalah siswa kelas XI/2 SMA Songsirm Wittaya School Hatyai, Songkhla, Thailand semester ganjil 2018/2019. Prosedur penelitian ini adalah (1) perencanaan, (2) pelaksanaan, (3) observasi, (4) refleksi. Instrumen penelitian berupa (1) pedoman wawancara, (2) lembar observasi, (3) angket, dan (4) soal tes. Pada siklus I ditemukan beberapa permasalahan: siswa masih bingung dengan materi dan model pembelajaran yang dilakukan, kendala bahasa antara guru dan siswa, dan beberapa siswa lemah dalam pemahaman bahasa Arab. Solusi yang ditawarkan: guru lebih detail dan rinci dalam menjelaskan materi dan model pembelajaran, guru dan siswa bersepakat saling belajar bahasa Arab dan Thai agar komunikasi berjalan lancar. Adapun pada siklus II permasalahan pada siklus I dapat diatasi, namun timbul permasalahan baru: ada kecenderungan siswa bosan dengan model Teams Games Tournament, dan siswa kesulitan dalam menggunakan kamus elektronik bahasa Arab. Solusi yang ditawarkan: dalam pembelajaran guru memberi variasi kegiatan berupa game tambahan, guru juga melatih dan membiasakan siswa dalam menggunakan keyboard Arab. Hasil belajar siswa setelah mengikuti pembelajaran dengan metode kooperatif model Teams Games Tournament meningkat signifikan setiap siklusnya. Peningkatan tersebut dapat dilihat dari naiknya nilai siswa dari pre test, post test I hingga post test II. Motivasi belajar siswa juga meningkat setelah mengikuti pembelajaran dengan metode kooperatif model Teams Games Tournament. Ini bisa dilihat dari meningkatnya motivasi dari siklus I ke siklus II. Saran kepada guru bahasa Arab, hendaknya meningkatkan profesionalisme dan kemampuan dalam mengajar. Dan siswa, hendaknya lebih bersemangat dan bersungguh-sungguh dalam belajar. Dan bagi peneliti lain, diharapkan melakukan penelitian sejenis pada keterampilan berbahasa lainnya.

Developing ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù Board Games as Instructional Media to Reinforce the Fifth Graders‚Äô Vocabulary. Thesis. Graduate Program in English Language Teaching. Advisors: (I) Drs. Fachrurrazy, M.A., Ph.D., (II) Dr. Sri Rachmajanti, Dip.TESL., M.Pd. Keywords: ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game, vocabulary. This study intends to develop a package of instructional media in the form of board game namely ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game as supplementary instructional media to reinforce the fifth graders‚Äô vocabulary based on the active, effective and joyful learning activity. Reinforcement is a part of learning which is important for the students in order to give satisfying result to their learning outcomes. In this study, ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game is developed based on the theory of cognitive domain (Lower-Order Thinking Skills to the Higher-Order Thinking skills in Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy (2000). Thus, this board game is developed into two levels: ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) and 2 (two). The tasks in ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) belong to the level of remembering and creating. Meanwhile, the tasks in ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 2 (two) belong to the level of understanding and creating. The design used in this study is Research and Development (R&D) by Borg and Gall (1983) and it is combined with the steps in developing a board game by Heinich, et al (1982). The steps done are (1) research and information collecting, (2) planning, (3) developing the preliminary form of the product including designing the activity and tasks, designing the display of the game boards, playing cards, students‚Äô and teacher‚Äôs manual guide, answer keys, and designing the rule of the play, (4) validating the product to the expert of instructional media in teaching English to young learners (TEYL) and the English teacher, (5) revising the product based on the validation result, (6) trying-out the product, and (7) disseminating and implementing the final product. To obtain the data in this study, the researcher used some instruments. They are (1) interview guide and field notes used in preliminary and needs analysis, (2) product validation checklist used in validation stage, and (3) questionnaire used in product try-out. Those instruments were analyzed descriptively. Before trying ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one ) and 2 (two) out to the fifth graders, the researcher validated these board games to the Expert of instructional media in teaching English to young learners (TEYL) and the English teacher. The result showed that the mean scores of these board games was in range 2.5 ‚Äì 3.2 or in category of quite valid and no revision needed, and also in range 3.3 ‚Äì 4 or in category of valid and no revision needed. However, the researcher still did some minor revisions based on some corrections and suggestions which were given by the English teacher and the expert toward ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games in order to make its quality better. The product try-out was conducted at SDN Indro which is located in Kebomas Gresik. The students who joined the product try-out were 89 fifth grade students of 5A class and 5B class at SDN Indro. ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games as the product of this study covered (1) game board of ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) and 2 (two), (2) playing cards: 131 playing cards in ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù bord game level 1 (one) and 131 playing cards in ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 2 (two), (3) students‚Äô playing guides in bilingual version (English and Indonesia), (4) teacher‚Äôs manual guide, and (5) answer keys. Besides, to play these board games, the students are equipped with buttons as the token and coins to substitute the dice. In the product try-out, the researcher distributed questionnaire to the students and the English teacher in order to get the feedback from the English teacher and to get the students‚Äô response toward the application of ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) and 2 (two). The result showed that most of the students and the English teacher who joined the try-out liked these board games and they were also interested in playing ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games. This was because these board games gave a chance for the students to learn while playing in enjoyable condition. Based on the result of the questionnaire which was given to the English teacher, ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) and 2 (two) have met its quality in terms of its display, content, utility, and applicability. Moreover, the questionnaires result showed that ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games were not necessary to be revised. Thus, the researcher directly got the final product of this study which was a package of board game namely ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game. Finally, it can be concluded that ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games developed by the researcher are appropriate to be used as instructional media to reinforce the fifth grader‚Äôs vocabulary at SDN Indro Kebomas Gresik. There are some suggestions for the English teachers who will use these board games. It is better for them to read the teacher‚Äôs manual guide accurately in order to get brief explanation about ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games. Therefore, the can guide their students before they play ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board game level 1 (one) and 2 (two). Next, for the further development or future researchers, they can simplify the language instructions in playing cards and students‚Äô playing guide. Then, the future researchers can apply these board games as a basic to conduct other research. Besides, the future researchers may also conduct the large scale try-out in order to get the better result in terms of product utility. In terms of implementation and dissemination, the researcher can implement ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù board games at SDN Indro as a place to conduct this research and disseminate these board games to the other schools which have same characteristics, problems, and needs with this school.

Nurul Muthmainnah., M.A. Key words : Board game, speaking skill, senior high school This study aimed at developing an instructional medium in the form of a board game called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on Your Mind?‚Äù to be used as the teaching medium to teach speaking. This board game was designed tomotivate the 11th graders of senior high school to learn speaking skill, create joyful and fun atmosphere for the students to learn English, especially speaking skill. The materials were chosen according to the syllabuson the first semester2013 Curriculum of eleventh grade covering the expressions of giving opinions, suggestion and offer, and hope and dream. The study adapted the steps of research and development by Borg and Gall (1983). The procedures of the study were needs analysis, product planning, product development, product validation, product revision I, product try-out, product revision II, and final product. To collect data in needs analysis, the researcher interviewed the teacher and distributed questionnaires to the students. The data from needs analysis were used to plan and develop the board game. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on Your Mind?‚Äù board game was developed by following the ASSURE model by Heinich (1982) and it was the modification of Snake and Ladder and Monopoly board games, consisting of board, player guide, situation cards, tokens, dices, and stickers. After being developed, the board game was validated by an expert in media development by administering validation checklist. From the results of expert validation, some aspects of the game were revisedsuch as,the clearness of the instructions, the grammar in the situation cards, and the topic. After being revised, the game was tried out to twelve subjects from class 11th Science II of SMAN 7 Malang, which were divided into two groups, each of group which consisted of students with low, intermediate, and high proficiency levels. The subjects were 11th grader students, selected by considering the teacher‚Äôs point of view of the students‚Äô achievement and the score of English in school report cards. To gain the data, the researcher interviewed the teacher, distributed questionnaires to English teacher and students, and observing the try-out process. From the try-out, the researcher revised the¬† size of the tokens and the board, the number and the color of the dices, and the size of the package. From the study, it could be concluded that the product was worthy to be used to teach speaking skill for 11th graders of senior high school. The game could help the students gain confidence in speaking up their idea in English. Some suggestions were given for the English teachers to act as facilitator in the classroom, condition the game for larger group of students, and modify the topic and reward of the game. Meanwhile, for the future researchers, it was suggested to develop more board games for other skills.

Dec, F. Hein, R. Trotter', 'ABSTRACT In the Utikuma and Red Earth fields of the northwestern Alberta subsurface, along the eastern flank of the Peace River Arch, the Middle to Upper Devonian Granite Wash is organized into two systems of partially superimposed clas- tic wedges that interfinger with, and are onlapped by, the Keg River and Muskeg formations. The lower and upper Granite Wash clastic wedges reach a combined maximum thickness of 70 metres. Granite Wash sediments represent a transgressive-regressive interplay between alluvial fan-delta and tidal environ- ments. In the Utikuma area, alluvial fan-delta massive or cross- to parallel-stratified pebbly sandstone, intercalated with minor conglomerate and mudstone, form fining-upward units. Fan-delta deposits interfinger with estuarine, and inter- tidal to bioturbated subtidal sandstone and mudstone of the Cruziana ichnofacies. Extensive horizons of pyritic black mudstone was deposited locally under dysaerobic and/or anaerobic conditions. Tidal deposits constitute the finest- grained portions of the Granite Wash, and interfinger with supratidal carbonates, algal laminites and evaporites of the Keg River Formation, most widespread in the Red Earth area. Uplift in the central part of the Peace River Arch triggered eastward and northeastward advances of the alluvial fan- deltas, and was responsible for westward backstepping of the clastic wedges. Concurrently, the northeast-trending basement highs and lows significantly influenced Granite Wash sedimentation. Consequent paleovalleys divided the alluvial bodies into narrow, confined drainage networks that facilitated the development of fan deltas and estuaries. The resultant irregular paleoshoreline locally restricted water circulation, allowing prolonged periods of fine-grained sedi- mentation under reducing conditions. The growth of algal mats and precipitation of evaporites occurred under semi- arid to arid conditions. The Granite Wash typically blankets the pre-existing passive paleotopography of the Peace River Arch, onlapping basement ridges with characteristic drape and pinch-out geometries. There is no compelling evidence that the north- east-trending paleovalleys were active grabens during Granite Wash sedimentation: large-scale \"graben-like\" features can be attributed to post-Granite Wash faulting, although the steep escarpments of a few paleovalleys may mark normal faults that were active before and/or during deposition of the Granite Wash. RESUME Dans les champs petroliferes Utikuma et Red Earth dans la subsurface du nord-ouest de lAlberta, le long du flanc est de lArche de Peace River, la formation Granite Wash du Devonien Moyen et Superieur est organisee en deux sys- temes en coin clastiques (\"clastic wedges\") partiellement superposes qui sont en relation stratigraphique par interdigi- tation avec, et sont chevauches par, les formations Keg River et Muskeg. Les depots en coin clastiques du Granite Wash inferieur et superieur atteignent une epaisseur maximale combinee de 70 metres. Les sediments Granite Wash representent une interaction trangression-regression entre des milieux de cone de dejection-delta et de maree. Dans la region dUtikuma, les gres caillouteux de cone de dejection-deltaique, massifs ou a stratifications obliques/paralleles, intercales avec des quantites peu importantes de conglomerat et de schiste argileux, forment des unites dont la granulometrie diminue vers le haut. Les depots cone-delta sont en relation stratigraphique par interdigitation avec des gres et des schistes argileux estuariens, et de la zone intertidale a subtidale bioturbee de lichnofacies Cruziana. De grandes etendues de couches de schistes argileux noir pyritiques furent deposees localement dans des conditions dysaerobiques et/ou anaerobiques.Les depots de maree constituent les parties les moins grenues du Granite Wash, et sont en relation stratigraphique par interdigitation avec les roches carbonatees, laminites alguaires End_Page 541------------------------ et evaporites supratidales de la formation Keg River, qui connaissent leur grande etendue dans la region de Red Earth. Un soulevement dans la partie centrale de lArche de Peace River declencha les mouvements vers lest et le nord-est des cones de dejection-deltas, et fut responsable du recul vers louest des depots en coin clastiques. Simultanement, les cretes et les creux du socle, orientees nord-est eurent un effect important sur la sedimentation du Granite Wash. Des paleovallees consequentes diviserent les masses alluviales en reseaux de drainage etroits et restreints qui faciliterent le developpement de deltas de cones de dejections et destuaires. Lancienne ligne de rivage irreguliere qui en resulta restreignit la circulation de leau par endroits, permettant ainsi de longues periodes de sedimentation peu grenue dans des conditions de reduction. La croissance de tapis dalgues et la precipitation devaporites se produisirent dans des conditions semi-arides a arides. Il est caracteristique que le Granite Wash recouvre de maniere etendue lancienne topographie passive de l Arche de Peace River, recouvrant en transgressivite les cretes du socle, presentant ainsi des formes typiquement drapees et amin- cies en coin. Il nexiste pas de preuves sans equivoque que les paleovallees orientees vers le nord-est etaient des grabens actifs durant la sedimentation du Granite Wash: des structures a grande echelle qui ressemblent a des grabens peuvent etre attribuees a la formation de failles post-Granite Wash, quoique les pentes escarpees de quelques paleoval- lees pourraient marquer lemplacement de failles normales qui furent actives avant et/ou durant la sedimentation du Granite Wash.

EnglishIn the field of paleontology, the description work of the species that have been kept in the fossil record is very far from being completed. So that in a dispersed way and around the world there is a continuous dripping of publications where new species are described. Within paleontology, equinology plays a significant role both at the scientific level and at the level of private collecting or in museums. Importance, perhaps motivated by the good conservation of the tests of echinoids, which is constituted by calcite, which favors its fossilization and provides a rich fossil record of the Echinoidea class. The interest of the work is to give an overall and current view of the description work of the Echinoidea class, from which no compilation work has been published since 2008. To have a photograph, a sample, of the what in happening now. On the other hand, it is wanted to deepen certain aspects that are often not analyzed. As the geographic location and the geological age in which descriptions are being made or in which scientific journals and for whom species are being published. The study concludes, given the work that has been possible to record, that over the !ast five years, 2014-2018, 74 new species of echinoids have been described in the world, by 77 authors, that have been published in 30 different journals, through 53 articles. From the geographical point of view, there are four hot spots of description of new species: the Maestrat basin, Egypt, Italy and the USA. In the stratigraphic aspect, the index of rarefaction, defined as the number of species described per million years, is adjusted to a decreasing logarithmic curve: as we move away in time descriptions become more sparse. The Cretaceous, however, is the most fertile period in absolute terms. European scientific journals continue to play a leading role in the publications of the studies on this subject. The most important contribution is that of Great Britain, followed by that of the Catalan Countries. A work that analyzed, from these different points of view, authors, magazines, geographic and stratigraphic distribution, did not exist at the moment, what is being done, at the moment, in the field of the description of the fossil Echinoidea.

Specialized literature has demonstrated how the fan surface shape and morphometry can be used as an evolution indicator in terms of changes in geomorphological processes that shaped the fans. In this study, we present the morphological characterization of two alluvial fan surfaces (Es Calo and Es Barrancar) located in the Northeastern coasts of Mallorca. These fans reached their maximum development during Late Pleistocene-Holocene climate cooling periods and low sea levels. Currently, alluvial sedimentation processes on Es Calo fan and Es Barrancar fan are scarce, also locally there are gullying processes and incipient soil formation and a dense vegetation cover. The main channel run incised within the alluvial deposits from the apex until the shore. By means of LIDAR point cloud datasets analysis, a morphological fan surface characterization has been performed assisted by GIS tools. This has allowed building high-resolution digital elevation models of each fan. In this sense, using these fan surface models, presence of two alluvial terraces adjoining the main channel and some paleochannels were identified.

('cleveland+team+teams+guardians+barren+field', 4, 'Who Will Guard the Guardians? Preventing Drug Diversion in Hospitals.', 'S. Ranji', 'The patient safety field rightly focuses on identifying and addressing problems with systems of care. From the patient‚Äôs perspective, however, underlying systems issues might be less critical than another unspoken question: can I trust the people who are taking care of me? Last year, a popular podcast1 detailed the shocking story of Dallas neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch, who was responsible for the death of two patients and severe injuries in dozens of other patients over two years. Although fellow surgeons had raised concerns about his surgical skill and professionalism almost immediately after he entered practice, multiple hospitals allowed him to continue operating until the Texas Medical Board revoked his license. Duntsch was ultimately prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment, in what is believed to be the first case of a physician receiving criminal punishment for malpractice. Only a small proportion of clinicians repeatedly harm patients as Duntsch did, and the harm they cause accounts for only a small share of the preventable adverse events that patients experience. Understandably, cases of individual clinicians who directly harm patients tend to capture the public‚Äôs attention, as they vividly illustrate how vulnerable patients are when they entrust their health to a clinician. As a result, these cases have a significant effect on the patient‚Äôs trust in healthcare institutions. In this issue of the Journal of Hospital Medicine, Fan and colleagues2 describe the problem of controlled-substance diversion in hospitals and review the contributors and potential solutions to this issue. Their thorough and insightful review highlights a growing problem that is probably invisible to most hospitalists. Diversion of controlled substances can happen at any stage of the medication use process, from procurement to disposal and drugs can be diverted by healthcare workers, nonclinical staff, patients, and caregivers. Perhaps most concerning to hospitalists, diversion at the prescribing and administration stages can directly affect patient care. Strategies used to individualize pain control, such as using flexible dose ranges for opioids, can be manipulated to facilitate diversion at the expense of the patient‚Äôs suffering. The review presents a comprehensive summary of safeguards against diversion at each stage of the medication use process and appropriately emphasizes system-level solutions. These include analyzing electronic health record data to identify unusual patterns of controlled substance use and developing dedicated diversion investigation teams. These measures, if implemented, are likely to be effective at reducing the risk of diversion. However, given the complexity of medication use, eliminating this risk is unrealistic. Opioids are used in more than half of all nonsurgical hospital admissions;3 although this proportion may be decreasing due to efforts to curb opioid overprescribing, many hospitalized patients still require opioids or other controlled substances for symptom control. The opportunity to divert controlled substances will always be present. Eliminating the problem of drug diversion in hospitals will require addressing the individuals who divert controlled substances and strengthening the medication safety system. The term ‚Äúimpaired clinician‚Äù is used to describe clinicians who cannot provide competent care due to illness, mental health, or a substance-use disorder. In an influential 2006 commentary,Leape and Fromson made the case that physician performance impairment is often a symptom of underlying disorders, ranging from short-term, reversible issues (eg, an episode of burnout or depression) to long-term problems that can lead to permanent consequences (ie, physical illness or substance-use disorders).4 In this framework, a clinician who diverts controlled substances represents a particularly extreme example of the broader problem of physicians who are unable to perform their professional responsibilities. Leape and Fromson called for proactively identifying clinicians at risk of performance failure and intervening to remediate or discipline them before patients are harmed. To accomplish this, they envisioned a system with three key characteristics: ‚Ä¢ Fairness: All physicians should be subject to regular assessment, and the same standards should be applied to all physicians in the same discipline. ‚Ä¢ Objectivity: Performance assessment should be based on objective data. ‚Ä¢ Responsiveness: Physicians with performance issues should be identified and given feedback promptly, and provided with opportunities for remediation and assistance when underlying conditions are affecting their performance. Some progress has been made toward this goal, especially in identifying underlying factors that predispose to performance problems.5 There is also greater awareness of underlying factors that may predispose to more subtle performance deterioration. The recent focus on burnout and well-being among physicians is long overdue, and the recent Charter on Physician Well-Being6 articulates important principles for healthcare or*Corresponding Author: Sumant Ranji, MD; E-mail: sumant.ranji@ucsf.edu; Telephone: 415-206-2651; Twitter @sumantranji', '2019', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=cleveland+team+teams+guardians+barren+field&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 41),

Wright', 'Author(s): Wright, Anthony Gerard | Advisor(s): Scheper-Hughes, Nancy; Holmes, Seth | Abstract: The Promise of Poison: Life in the Field of Pediatric Cancer Treatment is an exploration of the ideologically mediated practices through which people are made into different kinds of participants in processes of pediatric cancer treatment. Since the 1950s, the field of pediatric cancer treatment in the United States has become organized around a multidisciplinary model that the oncologist Sidney Farber dubbed ‚Äútotal care.‚Äù In recognition of the various forms of havoc that cancer diagnosis and treatment wreaks on patients and their intimate networks, Farber‚Äôs vision calls for multidisciplinary teams of biomedical and psychosocial professionals to provide various caregiving services to both patients and their family members, particularly parents/guardians. Since the time of Farber, many cancer treatment centers throughout the world have adopted some version of his model. In this dissertation, I explore practices of total care at Bay Area Children‚Äôs Hospital, which is the site of a major pediatric cancer treatment center in the San Francisco Bay Area. In doing so, I show how models of pediatric cancer care intersect with models of communication and youth in ways that can produce multivalent effects that range from therapeutic to iatrogenic. As young people and their families become positioned as participants in the field of pediatric cancer treatment, their lives become spatially, temporally, and ideologically re-arranged around the demands of particular cancer treatment protocols. In the process, they are not only promised the possibility of healing, but they are also warned about the negative, or iatrogenic, effects of treatment. While the negative effects of biomedical cancer treatment practices are commonly recognized, here I show how psychosocial caregiving practices can also produce harmful effects. One common way in which this occurs is via the subjection of individuals who identify as teenagers to habitats, artifacts, standards, and practices that were designed to facilitate care and communication between adults and young children. Such forms of subjection can enact processes of infantilization, alienation, and stigmatization that inhibit therapeutic interactions. As I will show, the processes that constitute total care are also mediated by ideologies of race, class, and gender that inflect models of care, communication, and youth. Patients and families who inhabit non-white and non-bourgeois identities may be particularly likely to experience the negative effects of total care insofar as it reproduces standards that derive from white, Euro-American, bourgeois ideologies that mark them as ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù people.', '2019', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=cleveland+team+teams+guardians+barren+field&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 41),

Based on a literature study, it has been emphasized that the level of managerial competence of a manager has a signifi cant impact on the eff ectiveness of team management. The first part of the article was devoted to the organization of the probation, welfare and guardian ad litem services team. Then, defi nition and functions of management were described. The tasks of the team manager are presented in reference to particular management functions. Afterwards, problematic aspects of managerial competences were presented. The key competences of a team manager were indicated, based on the managerial competence model developed by the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development. Also presented, was the impact of these competences on the eff ects of work. The summary highlighted the necessity of conducting empirical research, in order to explore the level of the team manager‚Äôs managerial competences as a determinant in the direction of changes and intensifi cation of training of managerial staff . It was also used as the basis for developing a model of the managerial competence of a person managing a team of probation officers.

Therefore, the team manager faces multi-dimensional requirements as the executor of the management process. They relate to qualifi cations in the area of knowledge, skills and experience, including managerial competences, as well as personality traits and ethical attitudes. By analysing the current state of knowledge in the field of managing the probation, welfare and guardian ad litem services team, one can get the impression that there are no publications that would develop this topic from the perspective of management science.

('main+contentskip+dow+search+edition', 1, 'New Versions of Old Favorites', 'C. Tenopir', 'Many electronic database systems popular with libraries have migrated to a Web-based interface. Dow Jones Interactive, DialogWeb, LEXIS-NEXIS, and STN have all recently come out with Web databases or new versions of existing Web products. Brief evaluations of each are presented. Full Text: RESOURCES FOUND ONLY on the web are an important part of nearly every search for information that librarians make as intermediaries or to help end users find answers for themselves. Yet many experienced online searchers hesitate to switch from the familiar versions of their old, faithful online systems. Power searchers can get what they need quickly by telneting to the command versions of Dialog or STN or by dialing up through the proprietary online front-end software for LEXIS-NEXIS or Dow Jones. While most librarians stick with the old ways, they send their end users to web versions of these systems. Now online services hoping to lure power searchers to the web have produced new web versions. In some cases we may have no choice but to switch. Dow Jones Interactive Dow Jones announced last year that beginning in March 1999 it would no longer support telnet access through proprietary Windows software. The mainframe computer that runs Dow Joness old online system is not Y2K compliant, and the company doesnt think it worth updating. However, information professionals complained that the web version does not offer the full functionality of the old system, in particular in the options for manipulating sets, saving searches, formatting, and printing articles. Experienced searchers want powerful search and manipulation features. Besides, many intermediaries are accustomed to the old system. In response, Timothy M. Andrews, VP of Dow Jones Interactive Publishing, announced a compromise. While the move to a web-only world will continue, by April 1, 1999, Dow Jones will create a special Windows interface to the web that mimics the current powerful system. According to Andrews, \"The product will look and function like the current software version, while offering improvements in article formatting and printing.\" It will provide access only to the Dow Jones Publications Library and supports only TCP/IP connections. Andrews explained that this new hybrid of proprietary software with the web platform will be marketed only to \"the small core of information professionals who demand different functionality and have to do things you cant do in the web browser.\" Dow Jones hopes that this software will be needed only for a year or two, until the company produces a more powerful web browser version. Advantages of web versions Dow Jones seemed surprised over experienced searchers hesitation to switch to the web version. The companys November/December 1998 DowLine newsletter announced the new Windows software but mostly provided a list of \"21 Reasons to Upgrade to Dow Jones Interactive on the Web.\" Both traditional online versions and web versions of systems have their advantages. A big advantage of any web version can be the availability of images, graphics, and better-looking documents. Versions of full texts in PDF, SGML, or HTML are much more readable than in old-fashioned ASCII. Dow Jones, for example, offers image versions of articles from the Wall Street Journal and 1200 other publications. The trade-off here may be in response time to download or view the image file. Web versions often offer better document viewing. While formatting options may not be as customizable or flexible, web versions often provide nicely formatted screens listing the titles retrieved by a search. The per hit charges are often waived in the short displays on web versions, which rely instead on higher costs for full text delivery. Dow Jones Interactive, for example, displays titles, source information, and lead sentences for free, charging only for full text. Trade-offs on the web The new model of online research--more interactive, relying on many different types of resources--meshes with moving between web sites and web versions of different systems. Without leaving the web browser, an online searcher can check a free web site, move between sections of a commercial service, or even switch between online services. In the Dow Jones environment, this means switching \"seamlessly\" to the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition or the Company & Industry Center, which are not part of the Publications Library. The trade-offs may be slow response time and long waits, especially in the middle of the day. Web versions may offer better connections to an organizations intranet or allow librarians to set up personal interest profiles easily for customized dissemination of information. This requires a clientele with predictable and recurring research interests. Information professionals appreciate how the web offers access to the latest versions of all system documentation. Experienced Dialog searchers, for example, may be accustomed to searching with Dialog Bluesheets, the database catalog, and the user manual spread out near their computer. It didnt take long to sell me on the idea of fully accessible Bluesheets online. The web version of Dialog allows easy surfing between a search and the documentation. Dialog has long been known for excellent documentation, but the web version to date hasnt drawn rave reviews from information professionals. Two new web versions deserve a second look. DialogWeb version 2.0 In early February, version 2.0 of Dialogs system came online. DialogWeb provides two search modes--the \"guided search,\" for users who are not familiar with Dialog commands, and the \"command search\" for experienced searchers. DialogWeb Command Search provides the familiar Dialog commands, along with some of the advantages (and disadvantages) of the web environment. Regular Dialog commands are entered in a command input box at the bottom of the Command Search main page. This pretty much resembles old-fashioned Dialog searching. One big difference: you can click on either \"databases\" or \"product support\" to view database details or system documentation. Expanded versions of database descriptions--including price, field tags, and field descriptions--help to formulate and refine search strategy. A new feature in DialogWeb 2.0 presents common fields on the search screen, incorporating some of the Bluesheet information. DialogWeb also eases database selection by providing access to DialIndex through the Databases option. As with DialIndex in the old command mode, it allows searching for words in the indexes of multiple databases, but the web version gives more convenient access to subject clusters. Databases are pregrouped into descriptive subject hierarchies in DialogWeb, so the searcher doesnt have to remember or look up the obtuse DialIndex subject code words. Bringing new users Dialog hopes that the improved Guided Search mode will bring new users to DialogWeb. According to a Dialog spokesperson, the users of the earlier version of DialogWeb \"tend to be those with less experience searching classic Dialog. Most are information professionals. Some are market researchers, paralegals, scientists, or engineers.\" Since the first version of DialogWeb required some knowledge of commands, \"the end users have a fairly high level of sophistication\" in searching. Dialog expects \"to start seeing users with much lower levels of search expertise and experience\" using the Guided Search mode of version 2.0. Guided Search will seem painfully slow to experienced command searchers, as users must first go through several subject focusing screens to select a database. The search process then progresses through search forms, pull-down menus, and check boxes that are translated behind the scenes into search commands, field or other limitations, and output features. Guided Search is not for experienced searchers or anyone who wants control over the search process, but it does instill a kind of logical order to searching, and the fill-in-the', '1999', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=main+contentskip+dow+search+edition&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 42),

Although physical literacy has been suggested to benefit the general population, the experiences of Indigenous peoples are noticeably absent in the physical literacy literature. To facilitate meaningful and inclusive sport policies and programmes in Canada, it is necessary to develop a physical literacy evidence-base that is grounded in the voices of Indigenous peoples. The purpose of this research was to explore Indigenous peoples‚Äô perspectives of physical literacy. Two research questions were used to guide the research process: (a) how do Indigenous coaches, educators, and youth mentors understand physical literacy?, and (b) what is the role of Indigenous coaches, educators, and youth mentors in facilitating physical literacy among Indigenous youth? Eleven Indigenous educators, coaches, and youth mentors served as collaborators in this community-based participatory research. One-on-one and sharing circle interviews were used to generate data. Collaborators‚Äô understandings of physical literacy, and their role in facilitating physical literacy among Indigenous youth, are represented by five themes: (a) wisdom sharing (b) being mindful in teachings, (c) youth-centered approaches, (d) culture and spirituality as part of being active for life, and (e) relational support. Findings from this research contributes to a more in-depth understanding of physical literacy in the research literature, and how the concept is understood in practice.

Yet despite their millennia-long tradition of investigating the continent, Indigenous explorers have been almost entirely absent from histories of North American exploration and, more broadly, from scholarship on the production and circulation of knowledge. This neglect has distorted some of these fields central premises, including the relationship between knowledge and empire. The history of Indigenous explorers reveals that exploration was not simply an instrument of imperialism but also a contested means of trying to withstand it. This use of exploration to defy imperialism was especially clear during the era of Indian removal, when a wide range of eastern Native peoples explored the West in search of knowledge that, they hoped, could forestall or mitigate expulsion.

Conclusions This study contributes to the literature exploring Indigenous youths‚Äô meaning-making process and engagements with land and nature in an urban context, and highlights the need for public health and municipal agencies to consider developing more culturally safe and meaningful natural environments that can support the health, resilience, and well-being of Indigenous¬†youth within inner-city contexts.', '2020', 9, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=columbus+indigenous+explorer+exploration+explorers+people+peoples+like&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 43),

It is very much a journey of self-discovery and recovery of a positive identity and lost human dignity that allows the restoration of pride to succeed with the gifts Creation provides to Indigenous peoples. Cook- Lynn (2007) addresses this quest to locate safe places of connecting to those stories in her important work Anti-Indianism in Modern America: Voice from Tatekeya‚Äôs Earth, where she writes about the obligation of Indigenous scholars to project strong voices to people who ‚Äúbelieve in the stereotypical assumption that Indians are ‚Äòdamned‚Äô.. vanished, or pathetic remnants of a race‚Äù and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get rid of Indian reservations‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs abrogate Indian treaties.‚Äù Instead of feeling inspired to find places of good will far too much energy is sapped escaping spaces of hate, indifference and inexcusable innocence. The cultural, historical and social confusion of a one-sided portrayal of Canadian colonization creates for researchers/witnesses at all levels of education huge gaps in understanding the unresolved pain and injury of Canada‚Äôs colonial past on Canada‚Äôs First Nations. Indigenous peoples are invisible in most areas of academic study, normally relegated to special programs like Aboriginal Studies as if Indigenous world-views, knowledge, culture and vision for Canada‚Äôs future required mere comma‚Äôs in course material that feel like ‚Äúoh yea, then there are aboriginal people who feel‚Äù that stand for inclusion but feel like after thoughts only if a visible ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù finds a seat in the class. Indigenous students‚Äô experience within the academy has is often a ‚ÄòDickenish‚Äô tale. It is a tale of two extremes; the best of times and the worst of times mostly simultaneously as each glorious lesson learned carries the lonely burden of responsibility to challenge the shame and humiliation of each racist, ignorant and arrogant colonial myth perpetuated. Like Oliver Twist we want more. This paper was conceived out of an invitation by Indigenous author Lee Maracle at the 2009 University of Toronto SAGE (Supporting Aboriginal Graduate Enhancement) writing retreat where Lee and the Cree Elder Pauline Shirt spun webs of stories to encourage Indigenous scholars to explore and express our survival of vicious, traumatic and intentional cultural upheavals.Thank you, Dr. Jean-Paul Restoule for your efforts to bring Cultural Safety to the University of Toronto.', '2020', 4, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=columbus+indigenous+explorer+exploration+explorers+people+peoples+like&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 43);

Martin', 'Abstract On 13th November 1905, the Danish sea captain Ejnar Mikkelsen presented his detailed plans to survey a hitherto uncharted region of the Beaufort Sea before the fellows of the Royal Geographical Society. Although much coveted ‚Äòundiscovered land‚Äô in this icy polar region had been hypothesised within geographical debates across Europe and the United States, no ‚Äòintelligent and scientific‚Äô geographical explorer had yet managed to conduct the essential surveying work required to prove or disprove this theory. With his planned expedition being met with approval, Mikkelsen then ventured into the frozen landscape of the American High North hoping to correct this intriguing geographical lacuna. It is here that the inexperienced Arctic explorer was to have a series of encounters with the indigenous inhabitants of the region from whom he learned more about the hypothetical landmass. Updating the RGS on his progress and communicating the details of these moments of indigenous encounter, Mikkelsen relayed a series of tales that had been gleaned from these local people. Considering these tales in terms of the circulation of geographical knowledge, this article will contribute to the growing body of literature that has highlighted the significant role that indigenous people have played in the exploration of the Arctic regions. More importantly, it will also highlight the ways in which these contributions have regularly been obscured or omitted from the prevailing historical record of Arctic exploration.', '2020', 2, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=columbus+indigenous+explorer+exploration+explorers+people+peoples+like&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 43),

The study followed a qualitative phenomenological approach. The multidimensional identity model, developed by Reyolds and Pope, was used as the framework through which to understand the participants‚Äô experiences. Semistructured, 40 to 60 minute interviewes were conducted with 6 women who identified as African American lesbians and attended HBCUs.

The findings suggest African American lesbians often shift between identities, depending on the situation or setting. The results of the study provide suggestions for counselors and counselor educators who will be able to increase their understanding of the unique needs of individuals who identify with at least 3 marginalized communities.

The purpose of this study was to determine the strength of the relationship between blood pressure control and prescription medication and lifestyle modification (smoking cessation, changes in eating habits, and weight loss). The target population were adult young Black men, and the control variables were age, low socioeconomic status (SES), and disparities in health care. A convenience sample of Black men (age 16-45 years) was obtained (N = 297) from the 2013-2014 NHANES dataset, and bivariate and multiple regressions were conducted after the assumptions were satisfied. The results indicated a statistically significant relationship between prescription medication and systolic blood pressure control (B = -4.327, p = 0.009). The findings of the study can promote social change by highlighting that medication compliance must be encouraged and adhered to by members of this high-risk group. However, further research is suggested to explore the efficacy of lifestyle modification closely to determine if this is a viable treatment option for young Black men of low SES in the United States.

The purpose of this study was to examine if there is an association between suicide attempts among African American/Black veterans and mental health support, income level, marital status, education level, and unemployment status. This quantitative study used the socioecological model to explain the association of the contributing factors to suicide attempts. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, and logistic regression were used to analyze the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. The publicly available dataset contains 55,271 cases with 6,698 Blacks/African American in the study. The findings of the study show 20% of African American veterans who seek support received it and 80% did not in suicide attempts among African American/ Blacks veterans and mental health support, income level, marital status, education level and unemployment status. The study showed there is a need for greater support for African American veterans through either policy or access to more mental health care.

The focus of this qualitative single case study was to explore customer-relationship management strategies managers use to improve financial performance from historically Black colleges and universities located within the state of Georgia with a student enrollment that exceeds 2,000 students. The conceptual framework for this study was the general system theory. Data were collected using semistructured interviews and employee handbooks. The data analysis consisted of compiling the data, disassembling the data into common codes, reassembling the data into themes, interpreting the meaning, and reporting the themes. The use of member checking and methodological triangulation increased the trustworthiness of the study. Themes that emerged were efficiencies with technology, student retention, and financial performance. Using up to date and effective technology including customer relationship management, and creating strategies to focus on student retention can help educational organizations improve their financial performance.

The purpose of this phenomenological case study was to explore managerial solutions for faculty satisfaction by applying Herzberg‚Äôs 2-factor theory to the insights and experiences of 12 tenure-track faculty members at an HBCU in the southeastern United States. Data were collected through semistructured interviews. The results were sorted, coded, and organized using content analysis software into key Herzberg factors that influenced faculty satisfaction at the study site. Work conditions, institutional administration and policies, personal attainment, and the nature of work were the primary themes. One major cause of faculty dissatisfaction was difficulty in teaching underprepared students. The results suggest the institution should focus on faculty development initiatives for effective teaching strategies, develop a faculty on-boarding process, establish an administrative leadership program, and improve the tenure and promotion process. Upon their implementation, such initiatives will promote a positive ambiance at the study site and improve faculty satisfaction and, thus, overall institutional effectiveness.

Marira', 'COLORISM IN ASSESSOR RATINGS: EXPLORING THE ROLES OF SOCIAL DOMINANCE ORIENTATION, METAPHORICAL ASSOCIATIONS AND SKIN TONE STEREOTYPES by Tiwi D. Marira Advisor: Dr. Kristin L. Sommer In recent years, public awareness of colorism, or discrimination based on skin tone, has grown. A previous study (Marira & Sommer, 2014) revealed that Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) (i.e., the desire for group-based hierarchy) predicted Black participants‚Äô discriminatory r√©sum√© ratings and hiring decisions in favor of lighter-skinned over darker-skinned, African American job applicants. This investigation focused on replicating and extending these findings by utilizing a more racially inclusive sample of Black and White adults and by examining more realistic candidate evaluation and hiring assessments. These simulated workplace assessments were embedded in an online business simulation requiring participants to make r√©sum√©, salary, role-play, and hiring ratings relative to both lighterand darker-skinned African American candidates. I expected to find that darkercompared to lighter-skinned African Americans would be rated lower on all exercise ratings, and that skin tone based discrimination would be most prevalent among participants with stronger vs. weaker SDOs. I also expected to find that these Colorism and Ratings v results would in part be explained by participants‚Äô beliefs about skin tone stereotypes and semantic connotations that are commonly ascribed to the colors of black and white. Contrary to these predictions, findings did not support the majority of these hypotheses. Specifically, exercise ratings did not generally differ between darker-skinned and lighter-skinned African Americans, nor was SDO a significant predictor of colorism. Further, negative and stereotypic beliefs regarding darker-skinned (vs. lighter-skinned) African Americans and the semantic connotations of the colors black and white were not reliably associated with SDO and candidate ratings. However, exploratory analyses revealed that stereotypic beliefs that African Americans with lighter (rather than darker) skin tones are friendlier and more attractive predicted higher salary awards and hiring preferences for lighter-skinned, African American candidates among White, but not Black participants. Furthermore, Whites‚Äô beliefs that lighter-skinned African Americans are friendlier than darker-skinned African Americans was associated with awarding higher r√©sum√© scores to lighter-skinned Blacks and more negative r√©sum√© scores to darkerskinned Blacks. For Black participants, stereotypic beliefs about greater attractiveness and friendliness among lighter-skinned Blacks was related to assigning more positive r√©sum√© and bonus awards to lighter-skinned Blacks. Unexpectedly, Blacks‚Äô stereotypic beliefs regarding greater professionalism among lightercompared to darker-skinned African Americans predicted assigning lower r√©sum√© scores to lighter-skinned Blacks. Reasons for these findings as well as their implications for theory and practice are discussed.

There are so many to whom I cannot fully express adequate appreciation, but will nevertheless try to here. That said, I can say with certainty and comfort that above all, I am most thankful to my Lord‚Äì a safe harbor to me and a guiding light enabling me to do all things. All along this journey there have also been a great many family, friends, faculty and furry companions (thank you Blizzy!) who have given me the inspiration, will and support to keep going.

To my Mum‚Äì Chipo Dyanda, and my Dad‚Äì Douglas Marira, I give my heartfelt thanks. Mum, thank you for gifting me with your persistence and enduring spirit. These qualities have been my foundation. Also, please know that it is not lost on me that even though as a 3 grader, tagging along to your doctoral seminars I told you, ‚ÄúI will never do a PhD, because I don‚Äôt want to suffer like you,‚Äù I did do my PhD. Dad, thank you for imbuing me with your sense of eternal optimism, enthusiasm for learning, and endless capacity for patience and forgiveness. These qualities and your belief in me have made me who I am. I love you both Mum and Dad. I would also like to express sincere thanks and appreciation to my advisor, Kristin Sommer. Your steady guidance, feedback, and very thoughtful insights into my research have always pushed and challenged me to be the best social scientist I can be. I am and will be forever grateful for this. My committee members, Charles Scherbaum, Harold Goldstein, Daryl Wout and Jennifer Feitosa also have my deepest gratitude for teaching me over the years and taking the time to review and help me shape this final manuscript. I would also be remiss if I did not express my appreciation and gratitude for the numerous grants and support I received from The Ford Foundation, The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, The Committee for Interdisciplinary Science Studies, and the Dean K. Harrison Fellowship Award, while I pursued this program of research. Finally, in closing these remarks I feel it important to acknowledge that even as I write these words, I believe there still exist large swaths of America, if not our world, that are firmly gripped by racial intolerance, blatant discrimination and resurgent xenophobia. These formidable social forces should not be ignored. Indeed, they remind me of Tajfel‚Äôs belief that, ‚Äú...the construction for oneself of full individuality is the privilege of social power.‚Äù Some 30 odd years later since the expression of this sentiment, our society‚Äôs persistent social inequities and the rancor of our present political discourse seem to bear much truth to this statement. However, I sincerely hope, as I believe Tajfel did, that his work, this work, and all past, present, and future work predicated on clarifying the intricate machinations of group relations, will increase our collective understanding and bring a time when every person holds the privilege and social power to freely define themselves.

Hicks MSW, University of South Carolina, 2003 BS, Benedict College, 2001 Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Human Services Walden University May 2017 Abstract The rise in the number of Black, male, incarcerated, rural youth and the retributive juvenile justice system is a prominent problem in the United States, creating a revolving door for youth in conflict with the law. Restorative justice is an alternative approach that diverts youth from court and focus on rehabilitation, but lacks sufficient experiential evidence from those involved in the process to support broader implementation. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of restorative justice arbitrators and the role they play in facilitating resolution of youth criminal charges in a rural setting in a southern U.S. state. The research question asked how restorative justice arbitrators perceive and explain their roles, and successes and failures of a restorative justice process with Black male rural youth. The theoretical framework for the study was Braithwaite‚Äôs reintegrative shaming, which posits the significance of the immediate family and community in rehabilitation. In this multicase study, research data were collected from semistructured interviews of 4 rural restorative justice arbitrators and analyzed using content analysis. Themes that emerged from the analysis were: the key role of rural community involvement in holding youths accountable to victims for their actions, preventing youths from developing a criminal record, and redirecting youth away from incarceration and more toward the community wellbeing. These findings contribute to social change by informing those working with youth crime about implications for the field of restorative justice specifically related to the opportunity for communities to provide benefits not only for juvenile offenders but also for victims and the community as a whole.The rise in the number of Black, male, incarcerated, rural youth and the retributive juvenile justice system is a prominent problem in the United States, creating a revolving door for youth in conflict with the law.

African Americans (AA) have one of the highest prevalence rates of T2D among all ethnic groups. African American Women (AAW) are 100% more likely to develop T2D compared with their white counterparts. The aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the relationship of the perceptions of AAW not previously identified that could lead to a reduction in risk of T2D among AAW. A cross-sectional study of 183 AAW 20 to 65 years old was conducted to identify any correlation among the variables, using validated surveys. The participants were recruited via flyers and online. The health belief model and the theory of planned behavior served as the theoretical framework. Spearman‚Äôs rho correlation was used to determine the strength of the correlations. The majority of respondents had moderate to high lifestyle and behavior changes relative to diet (59%) and blood sugar testing (93%), as well as low participation for exercise (62%). The majority of the AAW had low awareness of T2D severity (72%), low interference to daily activities (88%), and low social support for diabetes management (74%). A significant correlation was observed between healthy diet and severity, interference, outcome expectancies, and selfefficacy (p < .001). A significant relationship was found between exercise and severity, interference, outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy (p < .001). This study may inspire social change by creating awareness among healthcare workers regarding educational resources, environmental changes, and community interventions to reduce the economic burden associated with health care costs, to mitigate T2D, and to reduce health disparity.

Rommelfanger', 'A recent Nature article provided preliminary evidence that infants age 2‚Äì6‚Äâmonths old, who were later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), fixated more on the mouth than eyes and more at objects than people when viewing videos of typical childhood social scenes (1). While the sample was small, a reliable pattern of decline in eye fixation accurately predicted their level and classification of symptoms at age three suggesting that ‚Äì for the first time ‚Äì an infant could be assessed within the first 6‚Äâmonths of life for their potential of developing ASD (see Table ‚ÄãTable11 for studies that used eye-tracking with infants 12‚Äâmonths and younger). These eye-tracking devices, which are currently in clinical trials, could provide access to an affordable and objective tool with the potential for extremely early intervention. Detecting ASD risk during the first 6‚Äâmonths of life presents unprecedented opportunities to intervene, providing children opportunities to build critical skills before autistic characteristics fully emerge. Because the eye-tracking device allows for a non-invasive, portable assessment, the device could also enable pediatricians to provide comparable screening services globally. With such promise, a near future where infants are placed into an eye-tracking device at routine pediatric visits is compelling, if not guaranteed.', '2015', 386, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=oldthis+month+article+old+later&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 45),

However, how this expectation emerges during language acquisition is still not well understood. Assuming that the intermodal presentation of information facilitates perception, prior research had suggested that early in infancy, mothers perform their actions in temporal synchrony with language. Further research revealed that this synchrony is a form of multimodal responsive behavior related to the child‚Äôs later language development. Expanding on these findings, this article explores the relationship between action‚Äìlanguage synchrony and the acquisition of verbs. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, we analyzed the coordination of verbs and action in mothers‚Äô input to six-month-old infants and related these maternal strategies to the infants‚Äô later production of verbs. We found that the verbs used by mothers in these early interactions were tightly coordinated with the ongoing action and very frequently responsive to infant actions.

Dong, G. Fenati, Massoud Rabiei, Melinda Cerda, M. Neeki, Sara Wattenbarger', 'Introduction: Central cord syndrome (CCS) is a clinical syndrome of motor weakness and sensory changes. While CCS is most often associated with traumatic events. There have been few documented cases being caused by abscesses resulting from osteomyelitis. Case Report: A 56-year-old male presented to a regional trauma center complaining of excruciating neck and bilateral upper extremity pain. Computed tomography of the cervical and thoracic regions revealed severe discitis and osteomyelitis of the fourth and fifth cervical (C4-C5) with near-complete destruction of the C4 vertebral body, as well as anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 causing compression of the central canal. Empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy with ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin was initiated, and drainage of the abscess was scheduled. After the patient refused surgery, he was planned to be transferred to a skilled nursing facility to receive a six-week course of IV vancomycin therapy. A month later, patient returned to emergency department with the same complaint due to non-compliance with antibiotic therapy. Discussion: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis can result in devastating neurological sequelae, and literature supports immediate surgical debridement. Although past evidence has suggested surgical intervention in similar patients with presence of abscesses, this case may suggest that antibiotic treatment may be an alternative approach to the management of CCS due to an infectious etiology. However, the patient had been non-compliant with medication, so it is unknown whether there was definite resolution of the condition. Conclusion: In patients presenting with non-traumatic central cord syndrome, it is vital to identify risk factors for infection in a thoroughly obtained patient history, as well as to maintain a low threshold for diagnostic imaging.

Elman, Julia L Evans', 'UNLABELLED\nInfants, 18-24 months old who have difficulty learning words compared to their peers are often referred to as \"late talkers\" (LTs). These children are at risk for continued language delays as they grow older. One critical question is how to best identify which LTs will have language disorders, such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) at school age, in order to maximize the opportunity for early and appropriate intervention and support. Recent research suggests that LTs are not only slower to learn and speak words than their peers, but are also slower to recognize and interpret known words in real time. This investigation examined online moment-by-moment processing of novel word learning in 18-month-olds. A low vocabulary, late talking group (LT, N=14) and an age and cognitive-level matched typical group (TYP, N=14) of infants participated in an eye-tracked novel word learning task and completed standardized testing of vocabulary and cognitive ability. Infants were trained on two novel word-picture pairs and then were tested using an adaptation of the looking while listening paradigm. Results suggest that there are differences between groups in the time-course of looking to the novel target picture during testing. These findings suggest that LTs and typical infants developed strong enough representations to recognize novel words using traditional measures of accuracy and reaction time, however interesting group differences emerge when using additional fine-grained processing measures. Implications for differences in emerging knowledge and learning patterns are discussed.\n\n\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nThe reader will be able to understand many benefits of using eye-tracking methods to study young infant and toddler populations with and without language disorders. Readers will learn that examining moment-by-moment time course of novel word learning allows additional insight into different learning patterns.

Otake', 'To the editor Anesthesiologists generally perform preoperative examinations of patients undergoing anesthesia that will be managed by those anesthesiologists; however, anesthesiologists have not been paying attention to other cases. Hereby, we present a recently experienced case. A 55year-old male (168 cm, 62 kg) with severe renal dysfunction underwent reinsertion of a dialysis catheter under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine in the operation room in the daytime. For the case, the anesthesiologist was not involved in. After complaining severe pain during surgery, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest suddenly. We performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation following an emergency call. Since cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful, we suspected aortic dissection. We inserted a probe, performed transesophageal echocardiography, and were able to diagnose an aortic dissection. Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery was performed, and the patient‚Äôs aneurysm was repaired with a synthetic graft. The patient was discharged 1 month later without complications. If we had examined the chest computed tomography images taken 1 year, we would have seen thoracic aortic aneurysms that were 5.0 cm in size. This case prompted us to raise the question ‚ÄúWho should perform preoperative examinations of patients undergoing surgery under local anesthesia when anesthesiologists are not involved in?‚Äù Although the best answer is that anesthesiologists should perform preoperative examination in all cases, that is impossible from a manpower standpoint. The Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists established a certification system for perioperative management teams in 2014 [1, 2]. Following the case described above, our hospital began using Perioperative Management Teams, comprising certified medical staff members, to conduct preoperative examinations of all patients undergoing surgery under local anesthesia.

Sharma', 'No abstract available. Article truncated after 150 words. Introduction. Aspergillus is a ubiquitous fungal organism that causes a variety of pulmonary manifestations, both in immune-competent and immune-compromised patients. It can vary from simple colonization, Aspergilloma, ABPA to Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CPA) and Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) (1). ABPA is the most frequently recognized manifestation of allergic aspergillosis, caused by the immunological reactions mounted against Asp. fumigatus. Aspergillomas are rounded conglomerates of fungal hyphae, fibrin, mucus and cellular debris that arise in pulmonary cavities, as a late manifestation of CPA. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a long-term aspergillus infection of the lung. The most common form of CPA is chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which untreated may progress to chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergillus overlap syndrome is defined as the occurrence of more than one form of aspergillus disease (e.g., ABPA with Aspergilloma, ABPA progressing to IPA etc.) in a single individual.

The upcoming NASA mission Psyche: Journey to a Metal World, set to launch in 2022, will reach Psyche in 2026 and orbit the asteroid for 21 months [2]. Psyche is the largest exposed metallic MBA, and the mission will be the first of its kind to visit a metallic body rather than one composed of rock or ice [3]. Psyche is likely the remnant of a differentiated planet core from a time when planetary accretion was disrupted by frequent solid-body collisions [3]. However, because of its distant location and the limits of available measuring techniques, basic information about Psyche is under debate. Estimates of Psyche‚Äôs diameter vary considerably and typically fall in the range from 213 km to 264 km [1]. Estimates of Psyche‚Äôs bulk density typically range from 1.4 ¬± 0.3 g/cm to 4.5 ¬± 1.4 g/cm [1]. Psyche has two large impact structures in its Southern hemisphere [4]. The largest of these structures is estimated to be about 70 km in diameter and up to 6.4 km deep [4]. We aim to study the composition of Psyche by modeling its largest impact crater. We study various possible material compositions and porosity levels, and we compare the crater profiles in 2D and 3D to estimate Psyche‚Äôs material composition. The upcoming NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission will be the first mission to test asteroid deflection using a kinetic impactor [5]. The mission will approach the double-asteroid Didymos system and strike the smaller of the two asteroids, Didymos B, at an approximate velocity of 6 km/s. The subsequent orbital change of Didymos B will be used to determine the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor technique [5]. Prior to the mission‚Äôs March 2021 launch date, impact modeling is essential for making meaningful predictions on the effects of the kinetic impactor. Properties of interest include ejected mass, momentum enhancement, and orbital period shift. We aim to perform the same DART benchmarking tests on the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) hydrocode FLAG used by modelers using other numerical codes for the DART mission [6]. We demonstrate the viability of FLAG for the mission, and we use FLAG to contribute to the understanding of using a kinetic impactor on Didymos B.', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=asteroids+asteroid+news+nasas+nasa+cbs&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 46),

Nibhanupudy', 'Background: In recent studies, up to half of immunocompromised (IC) subject populations fail to develop antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination. Purpose and Methods: Here, we explore whether T-cells which respond to the spike (S) antigenic sequence and its less conserved S1, and the conserved S2 component are present in serial samples before and after each dose of mRNA1273 or BNT162b2 vaccines in 20 healthy immunocompetent subjects. Single samples from 7 vaccinated IC subjects were also tested. Simultaneously, we measured IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, and anti-S IgG, and frequencies of monocytic CD14+HLA-DR- (M-MDSC) and polymorphonuclear CD14-CD15+CD11b+ (PMN-MDSC) myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Results: In healthy subjects, S1-, S2-, and S-reactive CD4 and CD8 T-cell frequencies showed a numeric but not statistically significant decrease after the first vaccine dose and were accompanied by increased MDSC frequencies (p<0.05). After the second dose, S2- and S-reactive CD4 and CD8 cells and MDSC approached pre-vaccination levels. In healthy subjects, a) S1-reactive CD8 frequencies were significantly higher after the second dose compared with pre-vaccination levels (p=0.015), b) anti-RBD and anti-S IgG were present in all after the second dose. Among seven IC subjects, anti-RBD and anti-S IgG were absent in 4 and 3 subjects, respectively. S1-reactive CD8 cells were identified in 2 of 4 anti-RBD negative subjects. S-reactive CD4 or CD8 cells were identified in all three anti-S negative subjects. Conclusions: In healthy immunocompetent subjects, mRNA vaccines induce antibodies to the spike antigenic sequences and augment CD8 cells reactive to the S1 spike sequence, which is more specific for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Here, we constructed two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The immunogenicity of two vaccines was individually evaluated in mice. Specific immune responses were observed by priming in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger responses were obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were primed with 5 √ó 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S, followed by boosting with 5 √ó 109 PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S at 4-week interval. Both mice and macaques well tolerated the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost regimen induced high titers of 103.16 anti-S, 102.75 anti-RBD binding antibody and 102.38 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (pNAb) at 2 months, while pNAb decreased gradually to 101.45 at 7 months post-priming.

The dataset is characterized by simple background produced from nearly a single color. It looks simple but is actually very challenging for current co-segmentation algorithms, because of four difficult cases in it: easy-confused foreground with background, transparent regions in objects, minor holes in objects, and shadows. In order to test the usefulness of our dataset, we review the state-of-the-art co-segmentation algorithms and evaluate seven algorithms on our dataset. The obtained performance of each algorithm is compared with those previously reported in the datasets with complex background. The results prove that our dataset is valuable for the development of co-segmentation techniques.

We documented forty cases, thirty-six primary strabismus patients (Exotropia-Esotropia) and only 4 secondary cases were re-operated. All patients were evaluated after surgery clinically with good results, images were taken preoperatively and postoperatively. The follow-up visit was conducted after the first month and then every 6 months for up to 3 years. \n \nBy coincidence twenty years ago I lost a patient with loose adjustable suture after the recession of both medial rectus surgeries for ten days and He came back with good ocular motility and there was no need to readjust the suture !!...then. I observed ten cases of the loose adjustable suture during the first week of surgery (a loose adjustable suture is a loop created from the disinserted muscle to the original insertion of it out of conjunctival incision margins) \n \nIntroduction: \n \nHuge squint is a grey zone for most surgeons and there are no clear surgical rules as to which type of technique you may use for the squint surgery, and frequently re-operation is the option when operations fail many times. The protocol of the classical strabismus surgery is determined mostly by changing the mechanical actions of the horizontal muscles by resections or recessions and on how many muscles you operated. Far from this concept the check ligaments and intermuscular membrane play a role, or there is a neurological supranuclear pathway that controls the ocular muscle movement including the pathway in the brainstem and cerebellum and their connection to utricles and saccules of the inner ear and visual cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Indication indicates a cause for strabismus may lie with the input providing to the visual cortex. This allows for strabismus to happen without the direct impairment of any cranial nerves (or) extraocular muscles. \n \nAll patients had an oral and written agreement and the patient‚Äôs privacy was preserved. The surgical technique was as follows: under local anesthesia drops and subconjunctival (lidocaine 2%) injection 0.5 ml to 1ml with adrenaline near the muscle, (for children light general anesthesia were also done). We injected all patients with Atropine by an anesthesiologist through Intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) 1 mL/0.5 mg, eight (8 mm) conjunctival and tenon‚Äôs wound incision was done over the insertion of the muscle, and by muscle hook losing the muscle was done from the eyeball carefully than by the Mosquito clamps held the muscle prior to severing to avoid bleeding, full myectomy 2 mm from insertion was done no cutting of check ligament, no suture in the situation. I asked the patient to move his eyes to left and right after every step of surgery to estimate and to see whether he need tractional suture or need some dissection (not more than two mm) (traction suture is U shape 5-0 suture from the limbus to the outer canthal area in the opposite direction of the strabismus was performed for one or two weeks and for one or two muscle as needed to adjust the final position of the eye), the conjunctival incision is closed by bipolar diathermy. Orbital CT scan was performed within hours after the surgery to evaluate the adjustment of the muscles and confirm that it is in place and did not slip and that was due to saving the check ligament and the intermuscular membrane and tenon capsule, and also there was no resection to the antagonists muscles. Essentially, I used the Krimsky test to calculate the degree of strabismus, and some extreme cases by the Hirschberg test. the number of each case of those made, the type of strabismus, the preoperational degree, the procedure and other techniques, outcome, and the distance of resection \n \nResults: \n \n38 (95%) out of 40 cases, were successful and less than 10 PD with good ocular motility within one month. We found that under-correction only in 2 cases (5%). No overcorrection, one case re-operated (because she lost tractional suture early and became orthotropic. The other patient refused reoperation. The other procedure tractional suture (62%) was done, with no major complications during or after the surgeries, no persistent diplopia in the central 30¬∞ field, outcomes were documented by figures and video. \n \nDiscussion: \n \nThe main point is to say that the ocular muscles are reattaching spontaneously after free myectomy, I found a similar like myectomy technique has been done in 1983 by Prof. Caleb Gonzalez of bilateral sixth nerve palsy with strabismus fixus, disinsertion, and myectomy of OU medial rectus and released it in the orbit without sutures and also many others in last two century (18th - 19th) did like this technique and I found that too many American doctors were doing like this procedure in the 19-century, as Samuel David Gross, and James Bolton, and they published it with good results. Also, an important study (myectomy of large-angle strabismus in patients with Graves‚Äô ophthalmopathy) is done by dr. Liao SL and others at -Eye (Lond) Jur. 2017- and they said in conclusion that ‚Äúcomplete rectus muscle myectomy technique is effective and predictable‚Äù also don‚Äôt forget that the inferior oblique is attached again to the sclera after myectomy. Also, on 9/20/2018 the ‚Äújournal of pediatric ophthalmology and strabismus‚Äù published a nice original article in post-natal monkeys about ‚Äúspontaneous reattachment of the medial rectus after free tenotomy‚Äù if we considered our success rate 98% While the best rate ranges from 68% to 85% when we were using the traditional techniques, residual or recurrent strabismus was a common problem found after large-angle strabismus operations. \n \nConclusion: \n \nThis technique is remarkable in our ophthalmic field because it did not interrupt the natural integrity of the normal ocular motility, it is simpler, with a high success rate, requires a shorter time, under local anesthesia for adult, without suturing, much more efficient, with lesser complications, and shorter learning curve, the horizontal muscles spontaneous reattach and adjust after surgery. \n \nNote: This work is partly presented at World Eye and Vision Congress December 09-10, 2019 Dubai, UAE', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+credit+image+images+new+case+cases&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 49),

ABSTRACT Lung vessel segmentation has been widely explored by the biomedical image processing community; however, the differentiation of arterial from venous irrigation is still a challenge. Pulmonary artery‚Äìvein (AV) segmentation using computed tomography (CT) is growing in importance owing to its undeniable utility in multiple cardiopulmonary pathological states, especially those implying vascular remodelling, allowing the study of both flow systems separately. We present a new framework to approach the separation of tree‚Äêlike structures using local information and a specifically designed graph‚Äêcut methodology that ensures connectivity as well as the spatial and directional consistency of the derived subtrees. This framework has been applied to the pulmonary AV classification using a random forest (RF) pre‚Äêclassifier to exploit the local anatomical differences of arteries and veins. The evaluation of the system was performed using 192 bronchopulmonary segment phantoms, 48 anthropomorphic pulmonary CT phantoms, and 26 lungs from noncontrast CT images with precise voxel‚Äêbased reference standards obtained by manually labelling the vessel trees. The experiments reveal a relevant improvement in the accuracy (Àú 20%) of the vessel particle classification with the proposed framework with respect to using only the pre‚Äêclassification based on local information applied to the whole area of the lung under study. The results demonstrated the accurate differentiation between arteries and veins in both clinical and synthetic cases, specifically when the image quality can guarantee a good airway segmentation, which opens a huge range of possibilities in the clinical study of cardiopulmonary diseases.', '2019', 8, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=said+credit+image+images+new+case+cases&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 49),

Within his embrace he includes Greeks, Persians, Romans, pre-state or proto-state societies at the margins of empire and the non-Graeco-Roman subjects of the Roman Empire. The initial chapter ‚ÄòMeeting the Barbarians‚Äô provides a historiographical discussion of the word ‚Äòbarbarian‚Äô and its use in antiquity and by modern scholarship from the Renaissance to the twenty-first century. J. points out that when used by ancient authors the label was nuanced and depended on context; this is true from one ancient source to another, and even within various works, or a single work, by one author. By contrast, at least before the later twentieth century, modern authors frequently latched onto the statements of ancient authors to define national character, justify racist ideas, for example ‚ÄòWhite Man‚Äôs Burden‚Äô, and to promote imperialism. After the superb introduction, J. discusses the peoples of Greece, beginning in the Mycenaean world and moving through the collapse of the Late Bronze Age world, Early Archaic Greece, The Graeco-Persian Wars, the ascendancy of Macedon and the Hellenistic Age. J. then turns the focus to Rome, beginning with Pre-Roman Italy, Roman relations with the Italic peoples, Roman reception of Hellenistic influences, how different cultures subject to Roman rule partially assimilated ‚Äì or not ‚Äì to Imperial norms, relations along the frontier, and the influx and transformation of the Roman world. J. ends with a brief chapter that returns to a part of the theme introduced at the beginning. J. demonstrates an impressive breadth of knowledge in the chapters entitled ‚ÄòHow the Greeks Became Greek‚Äô and ‚ÄòGreeks Encounter the World‚Äô, his chapters on the Bronze Age and Early Archaic period respectively. Among the topics he explores are recent views on the origins of the Greek language, including the probability that the emergence of the language presumably resulted more from language shift, rather than from large-scale migration. At the other end of the Bronze Age, he rejects the dated conclusion that the collapse of the Mycenaean palace centres was accompanied by a parallel collapse of Mycenaean population levels, a conclusion no longer supported by the ever-growing body of archaeological research. In places, however, the study seems either a bit pedantic or obvious to someone familiar with the standard canon of ancient Greek or Roman authors. For example, his discussion of the varied interpretations of the ethical character of the Persians found in the pages of Herodotus‚Äô Histories, Aeschylus‚Äô The Persians or Isocrates‚Äô speeches. To nit-pick, in the chapter on the Hellenistic Kingdoms, J. identifies the Antigonids as the rulers of Macedonia. While this was ultimately the case, he compresses over 40 years of history into a single sentence. Perhaps this compression is justified by the scope of his study, but it obscures a complicated two generations of history. Not including monarchs who ruled for only a couple of years or less, Alexander‚Äôs half-brother, son, and then Cassander, held the title from 323 to 297. Demetrius, son of Antigonus the One-eyed, was recognised as King in 294, but was ousted in 288. It was only a decade later, after the death of Lysimachus (281) and one of Ptolemy‚Äôs progeny, Ptolemy Keraunos (279), that Antigonus Gonatas, Demetrius‚Äô son, claimed the Macedonian monarchy.

('karen+karens+people+white+whiteness+labeled+labelled+label+entitled', 3, 'Changing the Language of Addiction.', 'M. Botticelli, H. Koh', 'Words matter. In the scientific arena, the routine vocabulary of health care professionals and researchers frames illness1 and shapes medical judgments. When these terms then enter the public arena, they convey social norms and attitudes. As part of their professional duty, clinicians strive to use language that accurately reflects science, promotes evidence-based treatment, and demonstrates respect for patients. However, history has also demonstrated how language can cloud understanding and perpetuate societal bias. For example, in the past, people with mental illness were derided as ‚Äúlunatics‚Äù and segregated to ‚Äúinsane asylums.‚Äù In the early days of human immunodeficiency virus, patients were labeled as having ‚Äúgayrelated immune deficiency,‚Äù with public discourse dominated by moral judgments. Other examples apply to disability and some infectious diseases. In all of these cases, stigma and discrimination can arise when patients are labeled, linked to undesirable characteristics, or placed in categories to separate ‚Äúus‚Äù from ‚Äúthem.‚Äù Today, these complex themes have special relevance for addiction. Scientific evidence shows that addiction to alcohol or drugs is a chronic brain disorder with potential for recurrence. However, as with many other chronic conditions, people with substance use disorders (SUDs) can be effectively treated and can enter recovery. For example, medication-assisted treatment such as buprenorphine hydrochloride, methadone hydrochloride, and naltrexone hydrochloride‚Äîprovided in conjunction with behavioral counseling‚Äîcan be life extending for patients with an opioid use disorder. However, individuals with or in recovery from SUDs continue to be viewed with stigma, sometimes greater than that seen with physical or psychiatric disabilities.2 Commonly used terms can imply, or even explicitly convey, that the individuals with SUDs are morally at fault for their disease. Patients may be referred to as ‚Äújunkies,‚Äù ‚Äúcrackheads,‚Äù or other pejorative terms that describe them solely through the lens of their addiction or their implied personal failings. These word choices matter. Language related to SUDs does influence perceptions and judgments, even among health care professionals with substantial experience and expertise. For example, in one study involving a case vignette, doctoral-level mental health and SUD clinicians were significantly more likely to assign blame and to concur with the need for punitive actions when an individual was described as a ‚Äúsubstance abuser‚Äù rather than as a ‚Äúperson with a substance use disorder.‚Äù3 In a second study, mental health care practitioners attending professional conferences were less likely to believe individuals deserved treatment when they were described as a ‚Äúsubstance abuser‚Äù rather than as a ‚Äúperson with a substance use disorder.‚Äù1 Stigma isolates people, discourages people from coming forward for treatment, and leads some clinicians, knowingly or unknowingly, to resist delivering evidence-based treatment services. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health4 estimates that of the 22.5 million people (aged 12 years) who need specialty treatment for a problem with alcohol or illicit drug use, only an estimated 2.6 million received treatment in the past year; of the 7.9 million specifically needing specialty treatment for illicit drug use, only 1.6 million received treatment. The survey noted that reasons for not seeking treatment included fears that receiving it would adversely affect the individual‚Äôs job or the opinion of neighbors or other community members. Lack of insurance coverage, cost concerns, and not perceiving a need for treatment also contributed. Among health care professionals, negative attitudes regarding people with SUDs have led to diminished feelings of empowerment among patients, lower levels of empathy and engagement among health care professionals, and poorer outcomes.5 Not surprisingly, medication-assisted treatment remains isolated within SUD treatment systems, which in turn have historically been separated from the rest of health care. To help address these concerns, the American Medical Association has called on physicians across the nation to reduce the stigma of SUDs and enhance access to comprehensive treatment.6 The American Society of Addiction Medicine and major addiction journals have urged the adoption of clinical, nonstigmatizing language in communicating about addiction, as has the subspecialty of addiction medicine (established in 2015 by the American Board of Medical Specialties).7 Also, the 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has replaced earlier categories of substance ‚Äúabuse‚Äù and ‚Äúdependence‚Äù with a single classification of ‚Äúsubstance use disorder.‚Äù The federal government is now announcing new steps. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy is releasing guidance entitled Changing the Language of Addiction.8 Developed in consultation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and other federal agencies and stakeholders, this document will guide federal agencies in the accurate use of language regarding SUDs. The guidance offers ways to replace commonly used stigmatizing terms with alternative language more aligned with science. For example, the guidance recommends the following: replacing ‚Äúdrug abuser‚Äù with ‚Äúperson with a substance use disorder,‚Äù consistent with DSM-5; referring to a person as ‚Äúin recovery‚Äù rather than being ‚Äúclean,‚Äù because the latter term implies that people with this disease are VIEWPOINT', '2016', 85, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=karen+karens+people+white+whiteness+labeled+labelled+label+entitled&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 50),

In response to this in 2013 the My Care Choices Register (MCCR) was launched to record end of life care choices for those living in north east Essex with an incurable illness, dementia and frailty. Aims A marketing campaign was commissioned by the North East Essex Health and Wellbeing Alliance in October 2018 with a budget of ¬£50,000 with the aim to: Raise public awareness in north east Essex amongst local people about the MCCR; Enable potentially difficult conversations with loved ones; Enable more people to access the My Care Choices Register. Method An ‚Äòelephant in the room‚Äô campaign, with the elephant representing the conversation about future care including death and dying. The elephant appeared on backs of buses, bus tickets, bus stops, petrol nozzles, pharmacy bags, village publications, pens, mouse mats and key rings. We covered a diverse range of options to ensure we targeted as many people as possible. Segmenting this market was particularly difficult. The key promotional tool was an animation entitled ‚ÄòThe elephant in the room‚Äô. Produced as a modest, yet sophisticated old style cartoon to appeal to all ages. It has the ability to be a ‚Äòwhite label‚Äô film to be used by other organisations wishing to promote advance care planning. Results 1083 new register entries were created between 1 October 2018 and 31 March 2019, a 22% increase in new entries from the same period in 2017/18.

Banerjee, Duncan Wilson, H. J√§ger, D. Werring', 'Dementia is a global growing concern, affecting over 35 million people with a global economic impact of over $604 billion US. With an ageing population the number of people affected is expected double over the next two decades. Vascular cognitive impairment can be caused by various types of cerebrovascular disease, including cortical and subcortical infarcts, and the more diffuse white matter injury due to cerebral small vessel disease. Although this type of cognitive impairment is usually considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimers disease, there is increasing recognition of the vascular contribution to neurodegeneration, with both pathologies frequently coexisting. The aim of this review is to highlight the recent advances in the understanding of vascular cognitive impairment, with a focus on small vessel diseases of the brain. We discuss recently identified small vessel imaging markers that have been associated with cognitive impairment, namely cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, cortical superficial siderosis, and microinfarcts. We will also consider quantitative techniques including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance perfusion imaging with arterial spin labelling, functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. As well as potentially shedding light on the mechanism by which cerebral small vessel diseases cause dementia, these novel imaging biomarkers are also of increasing relevance given their ability to guide diagnosis and reflect disease progression, which may in the future be useful for therapeutic interventions.

As instruments of political coercion, the two processes participated in the production of images of individuals and groups opposed to land expropriation, particularly white farmers and political opponents in the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), that were at once grotesque and indicative of the polarized nature of political discourse in post-2000 Zimbabwe. The article evinces that naming and labelling participated in the articulation of the Zimbabwean Liberation War veterans‚Äô sense of entitlement to land, resources and preferential treatment by the post-2000 Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) government of Robert Mugabe. Using the Zimbabwean Liberation War context in which post-2000 Zimbabwean political culture of framing reality in exclusionary terms finds its roots and inspiration, the article explores how veterans of the Zimbabwean Liberation War used names and labels to categorize people and phenomena, separating so-called patriots from exploiters and sell-outs. The discussion also explicates how the Zimbabwean Liberation War veterans held themselves up as yardsticks of commitment to patriotic citizenship in the context of a perceived ZANU-PF war against neo-colonialism.', '2019', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=karen+karens+people+white+whiteness+labeled+labelled+label+entitled&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 50),

Coulson', 'with ‚Äúwhite slavery,‚Äù the coercion of young white girls into prostitution. In ‚ÄúThe White Slave: AmericanGirlhood, Race, andMemory at the Turn of the Century,‚Äù Micki McElya argues that Progressive-era reformers drew on popular memories of antebellum slavery to equate commercial sex in urban centers with slavery and to claim all white sexworkers, regardless of age, as enslaved childrenwho needed the public‚Äôs protection, a consideration that was never extended to enslaved black children. According to McElya, the popular memory of slavery not only propelled American modernity in the form of sweeping reform and the emerging genre of white slavery novels and films, but also ‚Äúset the contours of subsequent understandings of slavery and abolition to the present day‚Äù (p. 82). David M. Rosen‚Äôs ‚ÄúSlavery and the Recruitment of Child Soldiers‚Äù is especially noteworthy, if not controversial, because it cautions against hastily labeling vilified practices, such as child labor, marriage, and soldiering, as child slavery. In doing so, Rosen argues, scholars fail to account for the individual experiences of children and youths, as well as the historical ‚Äúmalleability of the age of consent‚Äù (p. 198). Plainly speaking, Rosen challenges the idea of a universal childhood. He starts by tracing the use of child soldiers from the American Revolution through World War II to illustrate that child conscription was not considered child enslavement in these eras. Shifting attention to Sierra Leone‚Äôs use of child conscription during its civil war in the late 1990s, he argues that taking seriously those children who testified to their willingness to go to war dismantles what amounts to ‚Äú‚Äòconstructive slavery,‚Äô‚Äù which results when child conscription is used as a proxy for slavery (p. 198). Child Slavery before and after Emancipation holds slavery scholars accountable for their selective engagement with childhood. For those who find comfort in their scholarly boxes, this volume will challenge them to consider the implications their work might have on the present day. Scholars who use oral histories will feel a sense of validation when reading this volume. The emphasis placed on valuing children‚Äôs voices and experiences is also very poignant. Scholars of antebellum slavery will especially appreciate the call to use Works Progress Administration (WPA) oral interviews to insert children into ‚Äúthe calculus of who counts as a slave‚Äù (p. 5). Karen S√°nchez-Eppler argues that once we recognize childhood as a crucial characteristic of the U.S. slave regime, ‚Äúthose very traits and conditions that have seemed to undermine the reliability and relevance of the WPA Slave Narratives become instead a source of insight‚Äù (p. 30).', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=karen+karens+people+white+whiteness+labeled+labelled+label+entitled&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 50),

(directed by Paulo Cesar Toledo and Abigail Spindel, 2015). In this way, the concept of the diva can be used productively to discuss Beyonc√©‚Äôs star image, while simultaneously recognizing its restrictive character. When, in a 2001 interview with COSMOgirl, Beyonc√© Knowles is asked if she is a diva like Diana Ross, she explains why she does not appreciate the comparison: ‚ÄúThat sounds cool, because she‚Äôs wonderful and glamorous. But people don‚Äôt mean it in the nice way. They call me that because I‚Äôm the lead singer, so they think I‚Äôm a diva and go around kicking people out of the group‚Äù (qtd. in Pointer 59). Earlier that year, Beyonc√© and her group Destiny‚Äôs Child were featured on the cover of Vibe magazine (February 2001). Shot by Vincent Skeltis, the black-and-white photograph mimics a well-known 1968 publicity picture of the Supremes, with Beyonc√© as Diana Ross. Flanked by her singing partners Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Beyonc√© strikes a classic diva pose, raising one arm triumphantly in the air. Inside the magazine, an eight-page article entitled ‚ÄúDivas Live!‚Äù discusses the group‚Äôs success, but also how ‚Äútheir lineup changes rival that of the Supremes,‚Äù suggesting that Destiny‚Äôs Child is merely a ‚Äúvehicle designed to promote Beyonc√©‚Äôs inevitable solo career‚Äù (Arambula 78). The cover and the article foreshadow the trajectory Beyonc√© indeed would follow. Like Diana Ross, who left the Supremes for a solo career in music and film, as well as the Ross-inspired fictional character Deena Jones in the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls, Beyonc√© left Destiny‚Äôs Child in 2003 to go solo and star in several Hollywood movies, including the role of Deena in the film version of Dreamgirls (directed by Bill Condon, 2006). From the start, Beyonc√©‚Äôs star image was perceived within the narrative of the black diva leaving her singing group behind to achieve superstardom ‚Äì even before she actually did so ‚Äì and starring in Dreamgirls reconfirmed this diva narrative both onand off-screen.

Beyonc√©‚Äôs answer to COSMOgirl highlights what Kimberly Springer has called ‚Äúthe dual nature of divadom‚Äù (256), namely that the diva label has both positive and negative connotations. On the one hand, diva is used to recognize a talented female star who enthralls and inspires her audience, harking back to its original Italian meaning of ‚Äúgoddess‚Äù that was applied to female opera singers during the late nineteenth century, and later to celebrated actresses in theater and classic Hollywood, and eventually to singers of popular music (Leonardi and Pope 205‚Äì27; Lister). On the other hand, diva is also used to denounce the female star ‚Äì ‚Äúusually a woman of color‚Äù ‚Äì as ‚Äúunreasonable, unpredictable, and likely unhinged,‚Äù and as someone ‚Äúwhose financial success has yielded excess‚Äù (Springer 257). Although diva has been applied to female stars of various ethnicities, there is a specific connection between the diva and black female performers, based both on the positive connotations of strength and survival within a white-dominated entertainment industry as well as on the negative connotations of excessive and unruly behavior, often based on racial stereotypes (Lockridge 1‚Äì18; Mask 7‚Äì9). Springer sees Diana Ross as ‚Äúthe template for contemporary notions of the diva as immensely talented but selfishly driven and difficult to deal with,‚Äù an image to which Beyonc√© is connected through her performance of Deena in Dreamgirls: ‚ÄúIt is hard to separate legend from fact, but with her ascension from group singer to lead singer in the Supremes and the larger than life aspects of her film roles it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between Diana and the Diva‚Äù (256). Beyonc√©‚Äôs diva pose as ‚ÄúDiana‚Äù on the cover of Vibe magazine signifies both sides, the diva‚Äôs talent and glamor as well as her manipulative character; legend has it that Ross would spread her arms as a dramatic gesture merely to block the faces of her fellow Supremes with her hands (Taraborrelli 182). Recognizing Beyonc√© as a diva also places her in a tradition of legendary black female stars: ‚ÄúAll the divas from Josephine Baker to Beyonc√© Knowles have been determined to prove that the black woman was to be taken seriously,‚Äù writes Donald Bogle is his pivotal study on black female stardom; black divas ‚Äúhave demanded respect‚Äù (16). Such an assertive attitude also has been crucial to the long ‚Äì and arguably dated ‚Äì tradition of gay male diva worship. As several scholars have pointed out, the performance of the diva, celebrating the fabulousness of glamor and excess, has provided gay male fans with a sense of belonging, presenting a utopian alternative to the realities of everyday life and the promise of a better future (Doty; Farmer; Jennex 343‚Äì46). However, the diva is not just a possible source of inspiration for gay men, but quite often also a product of gay white male imaginations, as Dreamgirls makes perfectly clear. The three men responsible for the original musical, as well as the director of the film version starring Beyonc√©, were all gay/bisexual white men, which might explain why Dreamgirls ‚Äúreflects the camp, surreal view of black divas that is a significant part of the gay aesthetic‚Äù (George 44). This is another form of the dual nature of divadom, as the diva can function both as a figure of self-determination and empowerment as well as a clich√©d representation or caricature in gay male diva worship. Moreover, the diva as caricature has been used by the entertainment industry to market female artists to mainstream audiences, of which the VH1 Divas televised concert series is the most obvious example. In 2000, Beyonc√© performed with Destiny‚Äôs Child as part of the VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute to Diana Ross show ‚Äì which, as the New York Times noted, was ‚Äúdictated, diva style, by [Ross‚Äôs] needs and impulses‚Äù (Pareles) ‚Äì and solo as part of the POPULAR MUSIC AND SOCIETY 7', '2019', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=karen+karens+people+white+whiteness+labeled+labelled+label+entitled&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 50),

Massey', 'Nancy Denton and I published ‚ÄúThe Dimensions of Residential Segregation‚Äù in 1988, during the early phases of a multi-year project funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The purpose of the project was to study the trends, patterns, causes, and consequences of racial and ethnic residential segregation the United States. Nancy was a postdoctoral research associate on the study at the time we began our investigation. In starting out, we encountered a vigorous debate in the literature about the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù way to measure neighborhood segregation that left us unsure about how to proceed methodologically. \n \nPrior to the mid-1970s, however, the measurement of segregation had been settled science. In 1955 Otis Dudley Duncan and Beverly Duncan published an article in the American Sociological Review entitled ‚ÄúA Methodological Analysis of Segregation Indices,‚Äù in which they examined a variety of proposed measures. They concluded that the best overall measure was the Index of Dissimilarity (D), given its ease of computation, well-known and tractable properties, clear interpretation, and invariance with respect to the relative number of minority group members. Over the ensuing two decades, a Pax Duncana ensued and D was widely used without debate as the standard measure of segregation. It comprised the main index for such classic works as Duncan and Duncan‚Äôs (1957) The Negro Population of Chicago, Taeuber and Taeuber‚Äôs (1965) Negroes in Cities, and Grebler et al.‚Äôs (1970) The Mexican-American People. \n \nThe Pax Duncana ended in 1976 with the publication of a critique by Cortese et al. entitled ‚ÄúFurther Considerations on the Methodological Analysis of Segregation,‚Äù also published in the American Sociological Review. The article unleashed ‚Äúa torrent of papers [that] considered a variety of definitions of segregation, proposed a host of new measures, and rediscovered several old indices‚Äù (Massey and Denton 1988:282). By the mid-1980s no consensus had been reached on how best to measure segregation and we uncovered some 20 different measures of the concept in our review of the literature. Before proceeding to the substance of our analysis, we decided we had to bring some order to the debate and so undertook a systematic analysis of segregation indices, resulting in the Social Forces paper. \n \nWe began by conceptually classifying measures with respect to five distinct dimensions of spatial variation: unevenness, exposure, clustering, concentration, and centralization. Unevenness is the degree to which the percentage of minority group members within specific neighborhoods departs from the minority percentage in the entire urban area. Exposure is the degree of potential contact (or lack thereof) between minority and majority members within particular neighborhoods. Clustering is the extent to which minority neighborhoods adjoin one another in space. Concentration is the relative amount of physical space occupied by a minority group within a city; and centralization is the degree to which minority members settle in and around the social or geographic center of a metropolitan area. \n \nAfter defining the indices mathematically and classifying them conceptually, we assembled data for the nation‚Äôs largest metropolitan areas in 1980, computed index values for Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians across all 20 measures, and factor analyzed the resulting set of indices to reveal their underlying factor structure. We obtained a factor pattern matrix that yielded a robust interpretation across different rotation and extraction methods, one that confirmed the conceptual structure we had hypothesized. Based on our analysis of the indices and our reading of the extant literature, we recommended an optimal measure for each dimension: the dissimilarity index for unevenness; the P* index for exposure; the spatial proximity index for clustering; the relative concentration index for concentration; and the absolute centralization index for centralization. The analysis and its conclusions were later replicated using a larger data set compiled for the 1990 census (see Massey, White, and Phua (1996). \n \nIn our SF paper, Nancy and I argued that social scientists should stop fighting about which measure of segregation was ‚Äúbest‚Äù or most ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù and instead measure all dimensions simultaneously to see what a multi-dimensional assessment might reveal about the nature of segregation in U.S. society. When then undertook this exercise for Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics in 1980 and found that African Americans were the only minority group to experience high levels of segregation on at least four of the five dimensions of segregation simultaneously, indicating a unique pattern of intense spatial isolation that we labeled ‚Äúhypersegregation‚Äù (Massey and Denton 1989). Although African Americans were the only group to experience hypersegreation in the 1980s and 1990s, by 2000 Hispanic communities in two metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and New York) had evolved to satisfy the criteria for hypersegregation (Wilkes and Iceland 2004). \n \nI had long been aware of the high degree of black segregation in urban America, of course. My Ph.D. dissertation had systematically examined levels and patterns of Hispanic segregation in urban areas throughout the United States (Massey 1978). Using African Americans as a base of comparison, I documented a wide range of Hispanic segregation levels associated with inter-urban variation in the generational and socioeconomic composition of the Latino population (Massey 1979a, 1979b). What really stood out to me, however, was not the variability of Hispanic segregation, but the intense and obdurate nature of black segregation. As of 1970 black-white was universally high and impervious to socioeconomic influences; but this was only two years after the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act (which outlawed racial discrimination in the rental or sale of housing) and several years before the 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which banned discrimination in mortgage lending) and the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act (which prohibited the practice of redlining). \n \nIn launching the study of segregation using 1980 census data, I hoped to see declines in black-white segregation in response to this legislation, but changes in black-white dissimilarity indices were limited and the discovery of hypersegregation only served to underscore the unusual depth and intensity of black segregation in the United States. At the time Nancy and I were publishing these results, a debate was raging about the causes of the ‚Äúurban underclass‚Äù and it was puzzling to us that the reality of black hypersegregation was systematically absent from the debate, which focused instead on the negative effects of urban economic restructuring on black wages and employment (Wilson 1987) versus the disincentive effects of the U.S. welfare system in discouraging work (Murray 1984). While segregation was tacitly acknowledged as a social fact by all concerned, it was not taken seriously as an explanatory factor in theorizing the perpetuation of urban poverty. \n \nIn the ensuing years, Nancy and I elaborated, extended, and applied the concept of hypersegregation and ultimately deployed it a principal theoretical construct in our book American Apartheid (Massey and Denton 1993). In the book we described how residential segregation perpetuated black disadvantage by concentrating neighborhood poverty and severing the link between social and spatial mobility that other groups historically had used to work themselves up the socioeconomic hierarchy over time. In subsequent years the term ‚Äúhypersegregation‚Äù and various permutations of the term entered the sociological and popular lexicon and came to stand for the unique nature of black segregation and the key role it played in promoting racial stratification in American society.

Records from 10 western United States dairy herds (mean herd size = 2058 cows) were evaluated retrospectively over an 18-month period. Eight bull breeding analysis cohorts were created (the first cohort 0-50 days in milk and the remaining cohorts at 25 days in milk intervals through 226 days). The cohorts contained non-pregnant cows that were first moved into bullpens during the described cohort period. Equal numbers of non-pregnant cows only exposed to AI during the cohort period were randomly selected from the pool of eligible non-pregnant cows. An AI cow was used only once in the data analysis, but was included in a bull breeding cohort at a later date if she remained non-pregnant and was transferred to a bullpen. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was used to compare the calving to conception intervals. Cows in AI groups had higher hazard rates for pregnancy across all cohorts. Parity and milk production were significantly associated with risk for pregnancy. In herds that practice a mixture of AI and bull breeding, overall herd reproductive performance might be improved by allowing cows more opportunities at AI prior to moving them into clean-up bullpens.', '2005', 26, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=peta+baseball+bullpen+bullpens+bulls+bull&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 51),

A ground beef traceback investigation was performed. Ground beef samples from patient homes and a grocery store were tested for STEC O157. Rodeo managers were interviewed regarding food vendors present and cattle used at the rodeos. Environmental samples were collected from rodeo grounds. Two-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) were performed on isolates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen patients with primary STEC O157 illness were reported in this outbreak. Isolates from all patients were indistinguishable by PFGE. Isolates from nine patients had identical MLVA patterns (main outbreak strain), and five had minor differences. Thirteen (93%) patients reported ground beef consumption during the week before illness onset. Results of the ground beef traceback investigation and ground beef sampling were negative. Of 12 primary patients asked specifically about rodeo attendance, all reported having attended a rodeo during the week before illness onset; four rodeos were mentioned. All four rodeos had used bulls from the same cattle supplier. An isolate of STEC O157 identified from a dirt sample collected from the bullpens of one of the attended rodeos was indistinguishable by PFGE and MLVA from the main outbreak strain.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nRecommendations were provided to rodeo management to keep livestock and manure separate from rodeo attendees.

But fashion also has a propensity for narcissism (self-satisfaction) and the potential for this self-satisfaction to be achieved through the harassment and degradation of others. In this article, fashion is examined as an everyday site for establishing social distinctions, where violence in the form of microaggressions and bullying is masked by the apparent superficially and innocuousness of clothing. The aim is to demonstrate how fashion is implicated in the three levels of everyday violence identified by Galtung (1990) in his typography of violence. The article takes examples from the cultural realm of fashion and a set of interviews with young people who experienced bullying because of their clothes. The examples are applied to Galtung‚Äôs model to produce a typology of fashion violence.

Kuhnert', 'Stroke is the second most common cause of death globally and an important cause of disability in adults. According to the GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS study, 1.6% of adults (1.7% of women and 1.5% of men) in Germany had a stroke or chronic consequences of stroke during the past 12 months. For those aged under 55 years, the 12-month prevalence of these health problems remains well below 1% for both sexes, but then increases steeply and disproportionately to 6.3% for those aged 75 years and over. Prevalence among women with a low level of education (3.6%) is higher than among women with a high level of education (0.6%). Education has only a weak effect on prevalence among men. The indicator analysed here (12-month prevalence of stroke or chronic consequences of stroke) was developed for the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) 2014/2015, which means that comparative data for Germany is not yet available. STROKE ¬∑ DISEASE OUTCOMES ¬∑ HEALTH MONITORING ¬∑ GENERAL POPULATION ¬∑ GERMANY Introduction Stroke is a disease of the brain characterised by sudden damage to brain tissue following either blockage of blood vessels (ischemic stroke) or bleeding (haemorrhagic stroke) in the brain [1, 2]. About 80-85% of strokes are ischemic strokes resulting from an acute blockage of a brain artery by a blood clot. Ischemic strokes are caused mostly by atherosclerosis of the carotid or cerebral arteries or blood clots from the heart caused by atrial fibrillation or heart valve diseases [1, 3, 4]. Haemorrhagic strokes in contrast typically occur due to ruptures of small arteries deep in the brain weakened by the longterm effects of high blood pressure. Insufficient blood supply or bleeding in the brain cause localised or generalized dysfunction to the brain, resulting in sudden neurologic symptoms. The most frequent symptoms are paresis (weakness) or paralysis and impaired sensation (numbness) of arm, leg or face (mostly limited to one side of the body), speech problems, loss of vision, dizziness, unconsciousness and severe headache. Stroke is the second most common cause of death in Germany and globally [2, 5, 6] and one of the most frequent causes of disability in adults [2, 6, 7]. One third to one quarter of all stroke patients die within the first year after a stroke [1, 8, 9]. Up to 40% of those who survive will suffer longer-term impairments in daily activities. They may find it hard to move, wash or dress on their own or to eat [1, 2, 10-12]. In many cases, this means they will Authors: Markus A.

Pleket', 'for a demilitarisation in the third century A.D. in the emerging di¬∂erentiation of military and civilian government, a radical departure from conventional views. Busch hesitantly suggests that the post-Severan depiction of soldiers in Rome (in military rather than civilian dress) represents an increased conŒºdence, which would suggest, potentially, an easing of tensions between military and civilian. De Blois, however, continues his vigorous defence of the notion of the third-century crisis in attributing at least some of the blame to a predatory military (cf. Adams). The papers on the Republic o¬∂er more coherence. Rosenstein and De Ligt develop lines published elsewhere, both contributing signiŒºcantly to the debate on second-century politics and demographics. Rosenstein argues that warfare acted as a demographic safety valve that encouraged Rome to maintain a ‚Äòhigh-pressure demographic regime‚Äô and to exist in relative prosperity. Both suggest that high numbers of military casualties led to a boom comparable to the economic resurgences after medieval plagues. Both models exist in some tension with the ancient sources, and in particular those relating to the Gracchi. One wonders how this picture relates to Giu¬∂r√®‚Äôs argument that much of the legal infrastructure for the professional army was in place two generations before Augustus, a suggestion that should lead us to think about the ‚Äòstructural di¬∂erentiation‚Äô of the army (contrast with Cosme). On cultural issues, Hilali argues that the camp of III Augusta was an extension of Rome, though he points to the later and gradual engagement with local deities. Stoll provides a very cautious treatment of the role of III Cyrenaica in religious di¬∂usion in Arabia. Martino argues that the army did not engage in technological innovation, though the issue of technology transfer is rather more complex. All three papers are hampered by a reliance on epigraphic material (can we reconstruct the religious life of soldiers from the euergetism and epigraphic habits of senior o Ãßcers?) and the complexity of separating ‚Äòcivilian‚Äô processes of cultural di¬∂usion from ‚Äòmilitary‚Äô ones; though this division o¬∂ers an intriguing parallel to Lo Cascio‚Äôs critique of the false divide between economy and administration. With a few notable exceptions, the collection is hampered by a reluctance to engage in debates, and to be brave in developing theories.

West', 'This paper presents findings relating to the crucial role of textiles in the Emotional Fit (Townsend et al. 2016) collaborative research project, which is investigating a person-centred, sustainable approach to fashion for an ageing demographic. Working with a group of Nottingham women (aged 55+) the team have accrued and responded to data drawn from in-depth interviews, wardrobe inventories and body measurements, to develop a collection of co-designed fashion prototypes that aim to meet the physical and emotional needs of their participants. By integrating geometric cutting with carefully selected and bespoke printed textiles, the resulting minimal waste garments enable wearers to express themselves via universal silhouettes incorporating multiple styling options, in support of personal agency and product longevity. \nTextiles act as the catalyst for the design and project development process by: providing a starting point for shape making through draping on the body and mannequin; as sensorial substrates to elicit tactile responses and interactions; as the surface for photographic imagery, engineered patterns and contrasting volumes, to be enacted by the human form. \nThe project demonstrates how such a co-creative or hacking approach necessitates a shift away from the established hierarchical fashion system (Busch 2009) that often undervalues its consumers. Here, by contrast, we actively explore the potential customer‚Äôs lived experience of the relationship between body, cloth and dress to inform a more holistic fashion design philosophy. The methodology challenges the generally accepted view of the textiles as subordinate to the practice of fashion, by documenting normally unspoken exchanges with the semantics of fabric through handling, manipulation, testing, printing, toiling and constructing. By reflecting on the aesthetics of cloth in relation to the emotional fit of clothing, we illustrate how it is intrinsic within the creative decision-making process, whereby embodied associations with the past point towards newly imagined wearable futures. \nby the Textiles programme at the University of Dundee between 2012‚Äì2014; collaborative design-led research projects that supported local medical and health care companies by providing key expertise in textile design, functional clothing design methodologies and user-centred processes for design-led innovation.

Satellite nocturnal images of the earth are a useful way to identify urbanisation. Nighttime lights have been used in a variety of scientific contributions, including studies on the identification of metropolitan areas as well as landscapes impacted by urbanization. However, the study of urban systems by nighttime light imagery has had a fundamental limitation to date: the low spatial resolution of satellite sensors. Although the DMSP Operational Linescan System (OLS) has been gathering global low-light imaging data for over 40 years, its 2.7 km/pixel footprint has limited its use for in-depth studies of urban development. The 2011 launch by NASA and the NOAA of the Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) satellite, with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on board, has led to a significant improvement. This instrument has better spatial resolution (742 m/pixel), on-board calibration, a greater radiometric range, and fewer saturation and blooming problems than DMSP-OLS data. However, it still has considerable limitations for the in-depth study of the area and internal structure of urban systems. The launch of Luojia 1-01 in June 2018 has increased expectations. LJ1-01 is a nano satellite that can obtain high-resolution nocturnal images (130 metres/pixel). The aim of this paper is to analyse, and compare with previous satellites, the new instrument‚Äôs capacity to delimit the urbanised area and its efficiency in identifying types of urban landscape (compact, dispersed and rurban).

The processing steps are modified from the original methods developed to produce annual nighttime lights products from nightly data. Only two years of VIIRS nighttime lights (VNL) were produced with the V.1 methods: 2015 and 2016. Here we report on methods used to produce a V.2 VNL time series from the monthly averages with filtering to remove extraneous features such as biomass burning, aurora, and background. In this case, outlier removal is achieved with a twelve-month median, which discards high and low radiance outliers, thus isolating the background to a narrow range of radiances under 1 nW/cm2/sr. Background areas with no detectable lighting are further isolated using a statistical measure of texture, 3 √ó 3 data range (DR). The DR threshold for zeroing out background rises as the number of cloud-free observations falls. The V.2 method extends the temporal leverage in the noise filtering by developing the DR threshold from a multiyear maximum DR and a multiyear percent cloud-free grid. Additional noise filtering is achieved by zeroing out grid cells that have low average radiances (<0.6 nW/cm2/sr) and detection in only one or two years out of eight. The spatial extent and average radiance levels are compared for the V.1 and V.2 2015 VNL. For the vast majority of grid cells, the average radiances are nearly the same in the two products. However, the V.2 product has more areas of dim lighting detected. The key advantages of the V.2 time series include consistent processing and threshold levels across all years, thus optimizing the set for change detection analyses.', '2021', 16, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=news+image+imaging+nasas+nasa+light+lights+picture&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 53),

To fill the data gap, this study explores the utility of nighttime lights (NTL) remote sensing images in assessing community recovery and resilience in natural disasters. Specifically, this study utilized the newly-released NASA moonlight-adjusted SNPP-VIIRS daily images to analyze spatiotemporal changes of NTL radiance in Hurricane Sandy (2012). Based on the conceptual framework of recovery trajectory, NTL disturbance and recovery during the hurricane were calculated at different spatial units and analyzed using spatial analysis tools. Regression analysis was applied to explore relations between the observed NTL changes and explanatory variables, such as wind speed, housing damage, land cover, and Twitter keywords. The result indicates potential factors of NTL changes and urban-rural disparities of disaster impacts and recovery. This study shows that NTL remote sensing images are a low-cost instrument to collect near-real-time, large-scale, and high-resolution human dynamics data in disasters, which provide a novel insight into community recovery and resilience.

Pearce', 'In spite of the abundance of myth criticism in our time, the degree to which twentieth-century literature has exploited myth has yet to be realized. Recognized as a present writer of the outdoor pageant play (in his words, \"symphonic drama\"), and a past writer of regional, \"folk,\" and experimental drama, Paul Green is another of those dramatists such as T. S. Eliot and Tennessee Williams who have turned to myth in search of universal meanings. Indeed, Green began writing plays in the early 1920s when myth was in the air. The seminal work, Sir James G. Frazers The Golden Bough, was published between 1890 and 1915, claiming to show the universality of myths. Jesse Westons From Ritual to Romance, 1920, had a similar impact. And T. S. Eliot revealed the significance of these writers in his notes to The Wasteland (1922). Greens plays written between 1920 (The Last of the Lowries) and 1934 (Roll Sweet Chariot) show a progress from folk materials and realistic manner toward a blend of folk-mythic matter and symbolic, anti-realistic technique. Green recapitulates, then, an historical development from the superficial American regionalism of the late nineteenth century to the search for deeper reality through myth, symbol, and experimental form. It may be well to note Greens early accomplishment as a realistic and \"folk\" dramatist before attempting to show how folk elements blend with myth in what may be Greens finest achievement, Roll Sweet Chariot. (1) That Green sought the essence of life and art in the elemental and the ceremonial, or ritual, is evident from his theoretic and critical works. In Forever Growing he writes that festivals such as those celebrated on May Day show that there is \"throughout the land a people alive with the sense of celebration.\" He feels that \"all folk arts\" exist as \"the decorations of life, the inspiration, the fire, and color and drive and depthful meaning of life.\" (2) Greens mentor, Frederick Koch, would make primitive ritual a direct progenitor of sophisticated theater: The elaborate snake dances of our Hopi Indians on the mesas of New Mexico and the three-day sun dance of the Shoshones in their Wind River country of Western Wyoming are colorful illustrations of the ancient culture of our aboriginal Americans. The civilized theatre is but the natural evolution of the song-and-dance drama of such primitive worshipers. (3) Greens early plays, of course, have provoked an image of the playwright as a rather simple, forthright craftsman who scarcely modifies the material he finds at hand in his region. Barrett H. Clark, evaluating him primarily on the basis of the early plays, justifiably emphasized the regionalism, simplicity, and artlessness evident in these plays. Because Clark was writing at such an early stage in Greens career, it was easy for him to overstress Greens being a farm boy who had made good in the theater, a figure not unlike the legendary Bobby Burns. Green was for Clark no \"literary man,\" in that he showed little tendency toward contrivance. Clark observed, \"In reading him I am stirred by no formal pattern of art or rearrangement of human characteristics.\" (4) He felt that Wide Fields and In Abrahams Bosom were \"direct transcriptions of the lives of men and women whose hearts are laid bare in all their simplicity.... The Field God and The Hot Iron are untouched pictures drawn with passion and gusto, set down without comment or factitious decoration.\" (5) Such judgments by Clark have perhaps been instrumental in leading other writers to view Green in the same light. Felix Sper writes that Green in the Negro plays copies \"life, not the theater.\" (6) One may detect a certain disdain in Spers observation. For him, assuredly, the native writer in his innocence and ignorance is closer to the wells of truth than is the sophisticated or learned writer who draws from a literary tradition. Confessing that Greens plots may be weak, Sper argues that \"in compensation, the air of casual progression he sometimes achieves resembles life itself. ‚Ä¶', '1971', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=nampeyo+art+arts+hopi+native+natives+clarke+clark&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 54),

Tokuda, T. Kuniya, K. Shibuya', 'Countries with rapid vaccination have reduced the COVID19 morbidity and mortality substantially.1 Japan has been ramping up the vaccination coverage, but the pace is stagnated because of the vaccine shortage at the time of the largest surge of daily cases since the pandemic began.1,2 There is a growing number of cases and hospital admissions among unvaccinated adults in the age bracket of 30‚Äì 50. This shortage is primarily driven by a general guideline of two doses with a threeweek interval for the public vaccination program. There are potentially enough vaccines for the first shot among adults,3 but the current schedule does not allow the vaccination of younger adults (aged less than 65) unless two doses of vaccination for the elderly are completed. The government has also introduced workplace mass vaccination program targeting those aged less than 65, which is also pending or canceled because of a shortage. Recent studies suggest that vaccination intervals could be extended while waiting for the arrival of additional vaccines (interval extension strategy) without compromising expected immunity.4 One of the major concerns about this strategy is that there is a tradeoff between wider vaccine coverage with a first dose and limited effectiveness particularly among the elderly population when we would extend the interval. Alternatively, half a standard dose of the vaccine (half a dose strategy) could also be used without compromising the clinical immune effects.5 The problem is that this is not officially recommended by the manufactures and regulatory authority. Here, we present simulated results of the COVID19 epidemic projections using these two alternative vaccine strategies in Japan based on cases, hospitalization, and morality from January 2020 until August 2021. The model mainly considered the spread of Delta variant with greater infectiousness; we assumed the basic reproductive number of 8 (greater than 2 times as infectious as previous variants) based on the data from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.6 A SEIR compartmental model with vaccination was used for the curve fitting by updating the estimation per wave.7,8 The infection rate was estimated for each period by fitting the model solution to the data before August 12, 2021. On the estimation, we used the data of daily vaccine doses after April 12, 2021.9,10 More precisely, we divided the population into elderly and younger populations after that date and assumed that if a susceptible individual is vaccinated, then he/she enters the first vaccinated class. In addition, we considered the second vaccinated class and assumed that the infection prevention effects by the first and second vaccinations are 30% and 60%, respectively, and the onset (symptomatic development) prevention effects by the first and second vaccinations are 40% and 80%, respectively. We, moreover, assumed that the immunity induced by the second vaccination will be decreased to 80% after 6 months and to 50% eventually. Assumptions for prediction after August 13, 2021, include the following: If the number of new infections exceeds 10,000 during the period of infection spread, restrictions (i.e., a state of emergency‚Äî a Japanese version of mild lockdown) will be declared. Restrictions will be lifted when the number of new infections falls below 1000 during the period of infection control. We assumed that the number of daily vaccines is 700,000 and allocate them to (i) elderly and younger people and (ii) the first and second vaccinations. The baseline ratios of both elderly and younger people were 5:5, and we discuss each scenario by changing these ratios. Figure 1A shows the results of changing the ratio of vaccine allocation between the first and second doses based on the interval extension strategy starting from September 2021. The number of infected cases would be decreased when more vaccine was allocated to the first dose. A larger number of the young people receiving the first dose seemed to have a greater effect. Next, also starting from September 2021, the simulation employed half a standard dose of vaccination (half a dose strategy) and thus doubled the rollout of vaccination with slightly lower (efficacy proportion = 0.9) or the similar (efficacy proportion = 1) vaccine effects. During the doubled vaccination pace, the simulation assumed three different distribution ratios for the elderly and young. Figure 1B shows the curves by the ratios: The distribution ratio is 5:5 (elderly:young) in purple curve. However, the number of infected cases seems to be decreased when distribution ratios of 3:7 (green) and 1:9 (blue) are used. These effects are likely to reflect that the vaccinated proportion has been already high among the elderly and only allocating more vaccine, such as 50% of the available vaccines, to the young could change the results. Even in the fulldose schedule (the uppermost graph of Figure 1B), such allocation could reduce', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=japan+country+countries+ozaki+covid+shot+shots&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 56),

In Pakistan, the religious pundits enjoy a huge following as well, coherent with this fact we would like to share our viewpoint towards the study. This study was conducted when COVID-19 was peaking around the world, which is during May and June. It is the right time to analyze the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) of populations especially when morbidity and mortality were heightened. Moreover, it can inform decision-makers for the second wave for which large-scale lockdowns and curfew seem especially impossible for developing countries and prevention and control of the virus will largely rely on the KAP of populations. We suspect that due to the cross-sectional nature of this investigation, there lies a risk of social desirability bias from the side of the participants when they were assessed for their attitude and practices. Hence a longitudinal and task-based approach to assess these qualities could give more reliable results. This research included 260 married individuals as opposed to 150 single, widowed or separated individuals. Therefore, any responses from the married participants would be dominant over those of the other group‚Äôs individuals. Due to this, we propose that a stratified random sampling method should be used in this regard to help in relating the responses in a correct balance. In Pakistan, religious leaders were seen actively taking part in the creation of awareness and instructing the public to follow the government‚Äôs stay-at-home orders. In the further battle against COVID-19 a strong coalition should be maintained between governments and other groups of people, especially in nations where they have large following, to smartly and effectively work towards prevention and control of the virus. The infodemic was likewise rampant in Pakistan. As in Ethiopia, the religious clergy believed that COVID-19 was the wrath of God, in Pakistan, the citizens took COVID-19 as mild flu, religious propaganda, governmental propaganda, a bioweapon or microchip to control humans and the influence of 5G mobile networks, etc. The sound prevention and control efforts should also include adequate check and balance of these unattested beliefs and stereotypes.

Kuehn', 'the Bulk of COVID-19 Vaccines High-income countries have reserved more than half of the world‚Äôs coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine doses despite representing just 14% of the world‚Äôs population, according to an analysis of publicly available data on premarket purchase agreements. The data show that 7.48 billion doses‚Äî enough to fully vaccinate about half the world‚Äôs population with 2 shots‚Äîhad been secured as of mid-November 2020. But so far, high-income countries have acquired 51% of the doses, leaving the remainder for lowand middle-income countries where 86% of the global population lives, according to the authors. For example, the US is home to about 330 million people, or 4% of the world‚Äôs population. But it has reserved 800 million doses, enough to vaccinate 400 million people. Although the US had about onefifth of all cases worldwide at the time of the analysis, other high-income countries with smaller populations and lower COVID-19 case numbers had secured a larger share of reserved vaccines. For example, the authors found that Japan, Canada, and Australia have a combined population of less than 200 million, but they‚Äôve reserved a total of 1 billion doses despite accounting for only 1% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. The COVAX facility, a global initiative led by the World Health Organization, has agreements with manufacturers to acquire 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including 1.3 billion doses earmarked for 92 lowand middle-income countries. That‚Äôs enough to vaccinate about 20% of their populations. ‚ÄúThe successful, equitable implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programmes requires unprecedented global coordination and a sustained commitment of resources‚Äîfinancial, logistical, and technical‚Äîfrom high income countries,‚Äù Jason Schwartz, PhD, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, wrote in an editorial accompanying the analysis. Clinical Trials Overlook Diseases of Low-Income Countries Conditions like respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and enteric infections that disproportionately affect low-income countries are consistently understudied in clinical trials, according to a recent study. Using machine learning technology, researchers in the UK and US analyzed 31 million articles in the PubMed database to identify 463 000 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between 1990 and mid2020. Then they examined how the health conditions studied most often in clinical trials compared with conditions that cause the greatest disease burden as measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYS). On average, they found that as DALYS for a particular condition increased, so did RCTs for that condition, but there was a lag: for every 10% increase in DALYS, RCTs increased by 5% in the same year. In addition, trials for conditions that disproportionately affect low-income countries were underrepresented in the analysis. About 7000 fewer trials were conducted for respiratory infections and tuberculosis than what regression models had predicted based on disease burden. For enteric diseases, there were 9700 fewer trials than predicted. The authors suggested that funding organizations rethink the way they allocate funding and invest more in diseases that impose the greatest burden or disproportionately affect lower-income countries. ‚ÄúGiven that the vast majority of trials are being conducted by the wealthiest 20% of countries, targeting national health priorities is not sufficient, and a global approach is needed,‚Äù the researchers wrote.

Background COVID‚Äê19 vaccination has started in most European countries with healthcare personnel being the first group receiving the vaccine shots. Their attitude towards vaccination is of paramount significant as their role in the frontline could help in the awareness of general population. Methods A study was conducted in Albania, Cyprus, Greece, Spain and Kosovo with the use of an online questionnaire. The Fear of COVID‚Äê19 Scale was used. The STROBE checklist was followed for this cross‚Äêsectional study. Results Study population consisted of 1135 nurses. Mean age of the participants was 38.3 years, while most of them were female gender (84.7%) and married (53.1%). Acceptance of a safe and effective COVID‚Äê19 vaccine was higher among Greek (79.2%) and Spanish (71.6%) nurses, followed by Cypriot (54%), Albanian (46.3%) and Kosovo (46.2%) nurses. Key factors for willingness to get vaccinated were male gender, living in a country with a high mortality rate in comparison with low mortality, being not infected with COVID‚Äê19, having high level of knowledge about COVID‚Äê19 vaccines and having been vaccinated for influenza in the last 2 years. Moreover, trusting the government and doctors regarding the information about the COVID‚Äê19 and having high level of fear about this virus were key factors for willingness to get vaccinated.

('insign+log+orders+home+little', 1, 'Implications of COVID-19 on Tennessee Exports of Forest Products', 'Andrew Muhammad, Adam Taylor', 'The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the globe since the first death in China in early January 2020. As COVID-19 began to spread across the U.S. in March 2020, businesses closed and individuals were asked to limit trips and comply with shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders (Baker et al., 2020). Countries around the globe imposed similar measures. Consequently, the pandemic has negatively affected the global economy beyond anything experienced in nearly a century. Estimates so far indicate the virus could decrease global economic growth by 3.0 percent to 6.0 percent in 2020 (Jackson et al., 2020). While there have been extensive stories about the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. food supply, little has been reported on how agriculture-related products primarily used in manufacturing have been impacted by COVID-19. In this report, we examine how the COVID-19 outbreak affected Tennessee forest product exports. The impacts of COVID-19 on forest products are due to supply and demand disruptions in both the finished wood products markets (e.g., furniture) and the interrelated market for raw materials and inputs (e.g., logs and lumber). Labor disruptions due to COVID-19 have resulted in decreased incomes, resulting in decreased demand for furniture and other finished wood products. Lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have limited shopping, also decreasing demand for these products. Given that labor is a primary resource for production, distribution and sales, stay-at-home and lockdown orders have also contributed to decreased sales due to limited product availability. Statista (2020) reported that U.S. furniture sales decreased by 21 percent in March and decreased by 49 percent in April when compared to previous months. U.S. imports of furniture and home furnishings were down $1.2 billion as of April 2020 when compared to same period (January-April) in 2019 (Census, 2020). This phenomenon is not limited to the U.S. (Jackson et al., 2020). Any decrease in demand for finished wood products in turn negatively affects the demand for forest products. It must also be noted that forest product sales, and exports in particular, have also been directly impacted by COVID-19. Labor disruptions have affected both production and distribution of forest products. Restrictions on movement have also affected transport and other trade-/market-facilitating activities (WTO, 2020), all of which have negatively affected Tennessee forest product exports. Like many forest-product exporting states, Tennessee exports mainly go to manufacturers in China. For instance, China accounted for almost half of Tennessee‚Äôs forest product exports in 2017 (Luppold et al., 2018; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Being so reliant on China for sales, Tennessee was particularly impacted by the U.S-China trade war, which is discussed briefly in this report and in a UT Extension report published earlier this year (Muhammad and Smith, 2020). More importantly, 2020 was expected to be a recovery year for U.S. exports due to the U.S.-China Phase One Trade Agreement (signed January 2020) and the announcement in February 2020 by China‚Äôs State Council Tariff Commission that U.S. commodities including forest products would be exempt from retaliatory tariffs (Inouye, 2020). Thus, it is conceivable that Chinese imports would have returned to pre-trade war levels in 2020. However, recent data show that not only did the COVID-19 outbreak thwart this potential recovery, but resulted in even greater losses when compared to 2019. In this report we examine how the COVID-19 outbreak impacted Tennessee forest product exports. To put this in context, we provide a background and overview of Tennessee production and exports and briefly discuss how the U.S.-China trade war impacted Tennessee. To assess the impacts of COVID-19, we examine the most recent trade data for 2020 and assess how Tennessee and U.S. exports in January-April 2020 compare to the same period in previous years.

Chabbra, Hardeep Singh, Dean F. Sittig, Neena Pahuja', 'Background: India is entering an era of technology revolution in health care. The current literature and experiences in global settings reveals that implementation of electronic health records (EHR) is often challenging. Although, data on EHR implementation is available from several countries including UK, USA and Canada, there is little data about EHR implementation experiences in India. This body of knowledge will be useful to guide future implementations of EHRs in the Indian context. In this paper, we discuss our early experiences of implementing a comprehensive EHR at four facilities of a single private health care system in India. We use a mixed-methods approach (both quantitative and qualitative) in our assessment. Rationale and Preparation for EHR Implementation: In 2009, the leadership of Max Health Care Institute Ltd. launched their efforts to implement open source Vista. Dell Services (Perot Systems then) were brought in a technology partners and the WorldVista flavor of VistA was chosen to be integrated to Max-HIS (Maxs home ground HIS). The main reasons for EHR implementation were potential reduction of medical errors, improved medication management, rapid access to vital and accurate information, reduced duplication of services and cost, access to a more comprehensive picture of health for promoting advances in the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, improved and informed decision making, and providing continuity of care to patients. To help prepare for this transition, the leadership also recruited external consultants to facilitate implementation processes and procedures. We used WorldVistA that included the following applications: progress notes, templates, computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medications, procedures, lab and imaging tests, Bar Code Medication Administration system (BCMA), pharmacy dispensing linked to drug orders and was capable of interfacing with Patient information management, lab, Radiology. Major organizational and workflow changes in preparation for implementation included identifying and using superusers, redefining workflows and training staff. Teams were setup to come and discuss \"as-is\" processes with the demo of the system. This facilitated the mindset change for the transition where new processes and procedures were written out of each section of the hospital. This was continuously done over workshops running daily for over 2 months. This prepared the future state. Three months before go-live classroom training sessions were setup with mock-live hardware and a curriculum to educate all users who would be affected by the system. Besides Doctors, nurses and health technicians, other operational staff, service and medical quality teams and medical records department were also trained. Superusers were chosen from the end users choosing the people who took to the system easily and also understood the processes. Settings: Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket and 3 other new hospitals of Max Healthcare Methods: We used a mixed-method approach involving three methods in measuring and tracking the progress of EHR implementation. First, we used a quantitative approach involving the use of six ‚Äúautomated‚Äù outcome metrics that were easily extracted from Mumps database which is the backbone of the EHR. These metrics included: 1) Use of Progress Notes; 2) Use of CPOE for medications, procedures, lab and imaging tests; 3) Documentation of two daily inpatient progress notes (morning and evening) by a consultant on all inpatients; 4) Generating Problem lists involving selection from ICD-9 coded problems; 5) Documentation of Input and Output logs by nurses on inpatient wards; and 6) Use of BCMA by nurses. Second, we interviewed four groups of representative users: senior consultants including head of units and head of departments, junior consultants (but not resident doctors), ‚ÄúFloor Mentor‚Äù who is a senior person team member who can be contacted by the patient or their attendants‚Äô in case of any problem during the stay of their stay in the hospital and the Nursing Supervisors. A total of 50 participants were interviewed. Content analysis of the interviews was conducted to identify major themes. Third, we used fact-finding questionnaires that obtained data from the same group that was interviewed. These provided objective assessment of ease of use, system functionality, and change management. Data is now becoming available 5 months after the EHR launch date (24th July 2011) and is presented briefly here. Additional data will be available in the next 3 weeks and is currently being analysed. Results: The Max Health Care Institute Ltd. implemented a comprehensive open source EHR in both inpatient and outpatient settings and underwent major organizational and workflow transformation changes to adapt. Table 1 summarizes the automated quantitative metrics, some of which show high usage patterns whereas other applications were slower to adopt. Use of CPOE is a stand-out because the organization mandated this as the only way to order in the hospital. Table 1: Automated measures to track implementation progress Implementation Metric % Use 1) Use of Progress Notes 76% 2) Use of CPOE for medications, procedures, lab and imaging tests 100% 3) Documentation of 2 daily inpatient progress notes (morning and evening) by a consultant on all inpatients 65% 4) Use of Problem lists involving selection from ICD-9 coded problems 15% 5) Documentation of Input and Output logs by nurses 82% in IPD, Critical care on parallel paper process 6) Use of BCMA by nurses Real Time MAR 41%, however including after the fact goes upt 78% Qualitative analysis showed that the younger generation of doctors was more comfortable working on the system, whereas the senior consultants were mostly hesitant to use this new technology and had low degree of adoption. Typing issues and EHR system ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù were raised as main concerns by several participants, but mostly from senior consultants. Because of time investment, many perceived reduction of efficiency. However, most users who had 2-3 days of hands-on EHR use immediately perceived its benefits and reported high degree of comfort in its use. Unfortunately, there was lack of support from the Super Users because they were many instances when they were \"off\", post-duty. Some of them were genuinely busy to not be able to help others. Differences between doctors and nurses also emerged; nursing staff were responsible for the maximum use of the system. Many facilitators of the process included support received from the top management, user friendly clinical templates and easy accessibility of all Max enrolled patients‚Äô records from any of the Max facilities located in various parts in the Delhi/NCR region and also from other locations such as Bhatinda and Mohali. The system quick response time and stability while using can also be credited with aiding its acceptance. Additional preliminary measures on tracking effectiveness of EHR implementation were instituted that showed room for improvement. For instance for CPOE, we started measuring proportion of stat medication orders that were filled appropriately and found only a 90% compliance. We also found an increase in the overall time in the discharge process when the EHR was only used partially, i.e. when both paper based and electronic records were available. This phase however is expected to be transitional. Nevertheless, EHR implementation led to the creation of certain new quality measures and quality expectations, a benefit that was well received among facility leadership. Conclusions and Implications: We report on an early experience of implementing a comprehensive EHR at four facilities of a large health care system in India. We believe that this is the largest implementation of its kind in India. Several lessons we learned about measuring and tracking the progress of implementing a comprehensive EHR could also be useful for other facilities in India ', '2012', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=insign+log+orders+home+little&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 57),

Seitz', 'The Beluga River field is a shallow gas accumulation that was discovered in 1962 while exploring for a deeper oil objective on a broad fault propagation fold in Tertiary stratigraphy of northeastern Cook Inlet, Alaska. This structure is a transpressional feature associated with right lateral motion on the Castle Mountain Fault; the northern bounding fault for the Cook Inlet Forearc Basin. Strata involved in the deformation are a thick sequence (up to 25,000 feet) of fluvial dominated non-marine to marginal marine volcaniclastic to arkosic sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone deposited in a rapidly subsiding and deforming basin during Eocene to Pleistocene times. The ubiquitous interbedded coals are thought to be the source of tremendous volumes of dominantly biogenic gas trapped in a thick (up to 3000 feet gross) package of stacked reservoirs that are encased in impermeable siltstone and mudstone. The recoverable original gas in place estimate for this field is 1.3 TCF 2 and it is a major supplier for local electric utilities and home usage in the Anchorage area. ARCO Alaska, Inc. operates the field for its co-owners Chevron and Municipal Light and Power. A recent study was undertaken to better understand the depositional environments and associated reservoir quality of the highly variable sand packages within the field. Although net to gross sand volumes are similar between wells, correlation of these sand packages is difficult because of lateral inhomogeneity of the fluvial system and the wide spacing of wells. Detailed correlation of the laterally continuous coal horizons has proven critical in deciphering the architecture of the sandstone bodies. Vertical positioning, reservoir thickness and quality, and facies analysis of both core and log character has provided a method of reservoir correlation that models sand continuity and ultimately provides the data for a series of isopach and pore-footage maps that help predict reservoir performance and variability throughout production history. Uplift of the volcanic arc and adjacent Mesozoic terranes provided clastic input that continued until the latest phase of deformation and uplift during the Pleistocene. This variability of the clastic source mineralogy can be problematic for reservoir preservation within the basin. High percentages of ductile lithic grains (predominantly volcanigenic) create a distinct and shallow porosity/depth trend that can destroy reservoir quality at depths as shallow as 7000 feet (Dmax). Early diagenisis of both lithic and metamorphic grains also precludes porosity preservation with the development of matrix filling clay. Variability of permeability within a single reservoir facies (at a given depth) can vary up to two orders of magnitude with little variation in grain size, sorting, and compaction. The presence and abundance of matrix clay appears to be the dominant factor is this local reservoir variability. The presence of bound and moveable water in the more unconsolidated clay-rich reservoirs can prove problematic with loss of reservoir integrity and ultimately sand production. All these factors play important roles in understanding and providing viable alternatives for continued delineation and development of the field.', '1999', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=insign+log+orders+home+little&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 57),

Asymmetry between right and left eyes was present (median BCVA, 71 letters vs. 74 letters), a finding supported by more advanced morphologic changes in right eyes. Participant age correlated with BCVA, but the effect size was small. If a neovascularization or macular hole were present, bilateral occurrence was frequent (33% or 17%, respectively), and BCVA was better than 20/200 (79% or 78%, respectively) or 20/50 or better (26% or 13%, respectively). Eyes with advanced disease (BCVA, ‚â§20/200) showed the following characteristics: (1) atrophy of the foveal photoreceptor layer with or without associated subretinal fibrosis; (2) an affected area, termed MacTel area, limited to a horizontal diameter not exceeding the distance between the temporal optic disc margin and foveal center, and the vertical diameter not exceeding approximately 0.8 times this distance (exceptions were eyes with large active or inactive neovascular membranes); (3) reduced retinal thickness measures within the MacTel area; and (4) less frequent retinal greying and more frequent hyperpigmentations compared with eyes that have better BCVA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSevere vision loss is rare in MacTel and is related to photoreceptor atrophy in most people.

A major challenge is that epidemics mostly happen in remote areas, where infrastructure for Biosecurity Level (BSL) 3/4 laboratory capacity is not available. As samples have to be transported from the outbreak area to the National Public Health Laboratories (NPHL) in the capitals or even flown to international reference centres, diagnosis is significantly delayed and epidemics emerge. Main text The East African Community (EAC), an intergovernmental body of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and South Sudan, received 10 million ‚Ç¨ funding from the German Development Bank (KfW) to establish BSL3/4 capacity in the region. Between 2017 and 2020, the EAC in collaboration with the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (Germany) and the Partner Countries‚Äô Ministries of Health and their respective NPHLs, established a regional network of nine mobile BSL3/4 laboratories. These rapidly deployable laboratories allowed the region to reduce sample turn-around-time (from days to an average of 8h) at the centre of the outbreak and rapidly respond to epidemics. In the present article, the approach for implementing such a regional project is outlined and five major aspects (including recommendations) are described: (i) the overall project coordination activities through the EAC Secretariat and the Partner States, (ii) procurement of equipment, (iii) the established laboratory setup and diagnostic panels, (iv) regional training activities and capacity building of various stakeholders and (v) completed and ongoing field missions. The latter includes an EAC/WHO field simulation exercise that was conducted on the border between Tanzania and Kenya in June 2019, the support in molecular diagnosis during the Tanzanian Dengue outbreak in 2019, the participation in the Ugandan National Ebola response activities in Kisoro district along the Uganda/DRC border in Oct/Nov 2019 and the deployments of the laboratories to assist in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics throughout the region since early 2020.

Deegan, Ruikang K. Wang', 'Penetrating vessels bridge the mesh of communicating vessels on the surface of the cortex with the subsurface microvascular beds that feed the underlying neural tissue. Their accurate identification in vivo is important in the investigations of neural degenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimers disease and stroke. Here, we propose an efficient method to automatically map cortical penetrating vessels based on an eigen decompensation analysis of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiographic signals. We first project the ensemble of repeated OCT signals into a feature space that represents the power spectral components of eigenvectors through a well-known eigen-decomposition method. A principal component analysis is then applied to the spectral components to identify penetrating vessels. We find that the spectral components of OCT signals captured from a cortical brain tissue follow a subtle logistic distribution, which is, however, broken down if there are penetrating vessels. Such feature allows for an automatic mapping of penetrating arterioles and ascending venules from large volume OCT-scan datasets, accordingly contributing to the topological and morphological analyses of cortical microvasculature in the functioning brains. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, an OCT angiography imaging platform is used to show the functional behavior of penetrating blood flows before and after an ischemic insult in an established middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rodent, where an average of 41% reduction in penetrating vessel density (n = 5 animals) was observed in the ischemic region post-MCAO.', '2019', 4, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=quot+oct+diseases+disease+project&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 58),

O‚Äôneill', 'S ince the first installment of our exploration of the causes and consequences of the Trump presidency, the Mueller Report has been, in part, made public. It did not resolve as much as either the president‚Äôs supporters or detractors had hoped. The former seized on it as a full vindication, echoing the president‚Äôs ceaseless claims of ‚Äúno collusion, no obstruction!‚Äù in the wake of Attorney General Barr‚Äôs exculpatory summary and subsequent unalloyed defenses of the nation‚Äôs chief executive. For the latter, it meant anything from disappointment, to a need for further congressional investigations, to the evidentiary record for impeachment on charges of obstruction of justice. Many Democrats have been wary of the new attorney general, not least because he had earlier penned a memo outlining an extraordinarily expansive view of executive power that cast doubt on whether he believed a sitting president could even commit obstruction of justice in the first place, and because he had also presided over the pardons of a number of Reagan-era officials convicted as a result of the Iran-Contra investigations earlier in his career. Emboldened by the actions of Barr and Republican support in Congress, President Trump has subsequently decided that ‚Äúfighting all the subpoenas‚Äù issued by House Democrats aimed at any legislative oversight of his administration and claiming blanket executive privilege over the Mueller report is the best way forward for the republic, thereby creating a fundamental battle over separation of powers and raising the specter of a constitutional crisis. Given the unprecedented pace of news in the past two plus years of the Trump presidency, no doubt by the time this issue comes to press there will be an entirely new set of heretofore unthinkable political actions to discuss. In the face of this, political science and political scientists labor on, trying to understand what it all means. This issue, like the prior one, opens with a selection of pieces which offer explanations for how President Trump won the 2016 election. In our first article, ‚ÄúThe Hillary Hypothesis: Testing Candidate Views of Loss,‚ÄùMichael Lewis-Beck and Stephen Quinlan test whether democratic nominee Hillary Clinton‚Äôs explanation for her loss conforms to reality. Relying on her memoir, What Happened, they show that her social and economic insights on why she lost ring true. However, they find little evidence that Republican harping on her use of a private email server for official business as Secretary of State or James Comey‚Äôs intervention into that investigation in October cost her the oval office. Clinton‚Äôs loss is further probed in Michael Sances‚Äô ‚ÄúHow Unusual was 2016? Flipping Counties, Flipping Voters, and the Education-Party Correlation since 1952?‚Äù Sances focuses on two widely accepted causes of the Trump victory: that counties that voted for Barack Obama flipped for Trump in 2016 and that white voters with low levels of education also switched allegiances in 2016. Sances shows that the number of county-flips was not all that different from past elections, even in pivotal Midwest states that changed from blue to red. Contrarily, the partisan divide by education was at record levels in 2016. He then runs a series of counterfactual analyses to tease out the relative impact of these changes. If the counties that flipped in 2016 had not done so, Hillary Clinton would have won the Electoral College by three votes. However, if the lowest-educated twenty percent of voters had voted by party in 2016 as they had in 2012, the democratic margin in the Electoral College would have been thirty votes. It seems that the education explanation trumps the countyflipping theory. Finally, Tehama Lopez Bunyasi examines the importance of white resentment in the 2016 Republican primaries. Making use of a unique data-source, the ‚ÄúNational Study of Color-Blindness and Race-Consciousness,‚Äù administered two weeks before the Iowa Caucus, she not only finds that Donald Trump is the most popular candidate among whites in the sample, but that his support grows among those who feel that being white disadvantages them to blacks on the job market.

As a result, readily transportable liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is becoming more and more popular and has a number of well-known advantages. With its high heating value combined with low carbon content, LNG enables a significant reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), while an absence of sulphur content eliminates emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) and reduces particulate matter (PM) to a negligible level ‚Äì and all with lower fuel costs. ‚ÄúBuilding on this initial reduction in GHG emissions, the Maritime Energy Transition calls for large marine engines to further change from fossil liquid-fuels to alternative, carbon-neutral fuels,‚Äù said Dr Gunnar Stiesch, senior vice president and head of Engineering Engines at MAN Energy Solutions. ‚ÄúHence, marine engines have to become capable of operation on a wide range of carbon-neutral fuels.

According to recent scientific evaluations, the potential global supply of MH is even higher than the total storage of traditional crude oil and conventional natural gas. However, its offshore extraction process could be linked to both catastrophic and non-catastrophic events that may contribute to global warming and climate change, cause harm to human health and life, endanger the flora and fauna, and threaten the very global environment as a whole. Therefore, from a legal viewpoint, an efficient and effective system of civil liability rules seem crucial to control the risks, and to compensate the victims to which damages may occur. This article takes into consideration China‚Äôs legal framework in assessing the risks connected to MH offshore extraction. Such a choice for examination is justified by China‚Äôs leading position for implementing the technology necessary for extracting MH. This analysis shows that China‚Äôs current legal instruments are still far from fully equipped to prevent the risks associated with the offshore extraction of MH, as well as to offer effective remedies for the victims once any damages have occurred. Therefore, more efficient measures and remedies should be considered (or even imposed) to address the specific risks of offshore methane hydrate extraction. Indeed, in the past few decades, China‚Äôs environmental protection laws and regulations have mainly focused on the environmental risks that may occur during the process of extracting conventional resources; however, they do not address methane hydrates specifically. This presents a legal challenge for environmental protection laws. The potentially catastrophic events that may occur as a result of the offshore MH extraction processes in particular present a legal challenge for environmental protection laws in China and across the globe.

Using the measurement of carbon dioxide, it was estimated that the flare was 87% effective in burning about 4,800 metric tons of the leaking methane gas.\n Emission estimates varied wildly, and both the Ohio (Pandey et al. 2019) and Texas (Cusworth, Duren, Thorpe et al. 2020) efforts to use satellites led to technical papers to consider how they addressed this challenge.\n For those with blowouts next year, chances are a lot better methane-emission data would be available because of the launch of a constellation of specialized methane-measurement satellites by the two groups that played a key role in the earlier tests.\n In presentations at CERAWeek by IHS Markit, GHGSat said it has two methane-detection satellites in orbit and plans the launch of eight more, and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said it is moving forward with the launch of its first one next year.\n Both are aiming to cover the lion‚Äôs share of oil and gas operations and measure the flow rate of the gas rather than concentrations in the atmosphere.\n They said they can do that far more accurately than was possible with the general-purpose climate observation satellites by focusing their equipment on the wavelength of methane.\n GHGSat said its satellites, which are about the size of a microwave oven, can measure the potent greenhouse gas from an elevation of 500 km and up.

Donnelly', 'Editors column\n For almost 2 decades, the world‚Äôs major gas producers have been trying to form an organization similar to OPEC that would offer stability to gas prices and give producers some control over security of supply and security of demand. With international spot trade of gas increasing and public pressure growing for cleaner fuels, the producers believe the time is finally right to become a major force in global energy markets.\n The main obstacle to establishing such an influential producers‚Äô group has been the lack of international spot trade that reflects current supply-demand dynamics. Unlike oil, most gas has been traded through medium- and long-term contracts for pipeline delivery, with the gas price usually linked to the price of oil. Gas producers often felt they were leaving money on the table in these deals, which hampered further gas upstream development. But that is changing with the recent growth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade on the spot market and the increase in gas output from North America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n While all eyes were on OPEC-plus members and what they would do about oil production in the coming months, the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) met in late November in Equatorial Guinea. Members include two of the globe‚Äôs top gas exporters, Russia and Qatar, along with 10 other members (including Iran, Libya, and Algeria) and seven ‚Äúobserver members‚Äù (including Norway, Iraq, Oman, and Angola). Notably absent from the group are two of the largest LNG exporters responsible for the fledgling gas spot market, the US and Australia, but GECF members control 70% of world gas reserves.\n One of the group‚Äôs worries is that, after years of talk about gas being a solution for cleaner energy, momentum for renewables in the wake of heightened concern over climate change could push gas to the sidelines. The oil and gas industry sees gas not only as a bridge to the future but a mainstay of future energy supply. ‚ÄúThis idea of natural gas as a transition fuel to renewables is strange,‚Äù Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said recently at an industry gas conference in Washington. ‚ÄúNatural gas is a solution (to climate change).

This is due to forage proteins being readily digested during rumen fermentation, compared to slower and poor digestion of plant cell wall components (cellulose and hemicellulose).

As a result, a great deal of efforts and resources has been spent on the research and development of high efficiency and low emission engines for automotive applications in the attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and levels of nitrogen oxides and soot emissions, which affect the air quality. This research has developed strategies to investigate the combustion characteristics, engine performance and exhaust emission of diesel‚Äìgasoline dual-fuel operation in a Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder optical engine running at 1200‚Äâr/min, equipped with a high-pressure common rail injection system for diesel fuel delivery, and a port fuel injection system, designed and manufactured by the author, for gasoline fuel delivery, in order to allow for dual-fuel operations. In-cylinder pressure measurement is used for calculating all engine parameters, heat release rate and efficiency. In addition to the thermodynamic analysis of the combustion parameters, high-speed imaging of spray and combustion chemiluminescence was used for the optical analysis of the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on auto-ignition and combustion processes. Effects of different substitution ratios and diesel injection strategies at low engine loads were studied when the total fuel energy was kept constant. The three main substitution ratios used in this study include 45%, 60% and 75%, which also indicates the amount of fuel energy from port-injected gasoline, where the rest is provided by the direct injection of diesel. Depending on the testing conditions, such as injection strategy and intake conditions, some dual-fuel operations were able to deliver high efficiency and improved emissions compared to that of a pure diesel engine operation, with the diesel‚Äìgasoline operation offering more consistency in improved thermal efficiency. The optical analysis of the combustion illustrates the main difference in the flame propagation, distribution and quality for each substitution percentage, as well as the condition under examination. It was observed that combustions with higher concentration of diesel fuel having more diffusion-like combustion, especially with diesel injection timings closer to the top dead centre, where there is less time for the two fuel and air to properly mix before combustion occurs, resulted in higher temperature and levels of NOx due to the pockets of high diesel concentrations within the combustion chamber, whereas higher concentration of gasoline, especially at earlier diesel injection timings, resulted in more homogeneous fuel mixture and thus lower combustion temperatures. In other words, when the gasoline substitution ratio is lower, optimised start of injection is advanced further, so that richer diesel mixture needs longer ignition delay to have proper combustion timing, and combustion is milder and peak heat release rate is slightly lower due to less local diesel rich mixture area by means of earlier injection timing, and in terms of emissions, lower gasoline substitution ratio, decreases NOx with more homogeneous diesel mixture, and same can be said for total hydrocarbon. Performing the thermodynamics testing with an all metal piston alongside the optical testing allowed for the confirmation of these outcomes.

While luciferases from firefly and Renilla have long been used for analysis of intracellular expression, the luciferase (GLuc) from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, has gained popularity, primarily because it is secreted and displays a very high light intensity. Firefly luciferase is characterized by kinetic behavior which is consistent with conventional steady-state Michaelis-Menten kinetics (termed ‚Äúglow‚Äù kinetics). GLuc, conversely, displays what has been termed ‚Äúflash‚Äù kinetics which signify a burst in light emission followed by a rapid decay. As the mechanistic background for this behavior is poorly characterized, we decided to decipher the mechanism in more detail. We show that decay in light signal is not due to depletion of substrate, but rather is caused by the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Inactivation takes place after between 10 and 200 reaction cycles, depending on substrate concentration. We found that the rate of inactivation is described by the sum of two exponentials with associated rate constants. The dominant of these of these increases linearly with substrate concentration while the minor is substrate-concentration independent. In terms of rate of initial luminescence reaction, this increases with the substrate concentration to the power of 1.53 and shows no signs of saturation up to 10 ŒºM coelenterazine.

When the temperature is decreased to the region of 10.5‚Äì9 ¬∞C, the peak gets blue-shifted and the flash-duration increased abnormally with large fluctuation; this possibly implies cold denaturation of the luciferase. We conclude that the first or hot effect is very likely to be the reason of the species being dark-active on hot days, and the second or cold one is the probable reason for its disappearance at the onset of the winter. Our study makes the inference that these two happenings determine the temperature-tolerance, which plays a major role in the selection of the habitat for the firefly.', '2021', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=luciferase+luciferases+fireflies+firefly+flash+flashing+light+lighting+like&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 61),

Stanger-Hall, D. Hall', 'BackgroundGenes underlying signal production and reception are expected to evolve to maximize signal detection in specific environments. Fireflies vary in their light signal color both within and between species, and thus provide an excellent system in which to study signal production and reception in the context of signaling environments. Differences in signal color have been hypothesized to be due to variation in the sequence of luciferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the light reaction. Similarly, differences in visual sensitivity, which are expected to match signal color, have been hypothesized to be due to variation in the sequence of opsins, the protein component of visual pigments. Here we investigated (1) whether sequence variation in luciferase correlates with variation in signal color and (2) whether sequence variation in opsins correlates with inferred matching visual sensitivity across populations of a widespread North American firefly species, Photinus pyralis. We further tested (3) whether selection has acted on these loci by examining their population-level differentiation relative to the distribution of differentiation derived from a genome-wide sample of loci generated by double-digest RADseq.ResultsWe found virtually no coding variation in luciferase or opsins. However, there was extreme divergence in non-coding variation in luciferase across populations relative to a panel of random genomic loci.ConclusionsThe absence of protein variation at both loci challenges the paradigm that variation in signal color and visual sensitivity in fireflies is exclusively due to coding variation in luciferase and opsin genes. Instead, flash color variation within species must involve other mechanisms, such as abdominal pigmentation or regulation of light organ physiology. Evidence for selection at non-coding variation in luciferase suggests that selection is targeting luciferase regulation and may favor differ expression levels across populations.', '2018', 6, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=luciferase+luciferases+fireflies+firefly+flash+flashing+light+lighting+like&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 61),

The steady-state emission spectrum from this species comes out to be apparently similar to those from the other two Indian summer species, Luciola praeusta and Asymmetricata circumdata: asymmetric in nature with a little bit of change in the position of the peak wavelength and in the width of the full width at half maximum. An increase in temperature to approximately 28¬∞C causes a red-shift in the peak wavelength, which probably indicates denaturation of the enzyme luciferase in the live, flashing condition. Emissions in the time domain reveal that the light is never completely off ‚Äì it decreases in intensity to a low value, sometimes very close to zero, and then increases ‚Äì a characteristic unheard-of till date.

Here, we show a temporal change in the light color emitted during the reaction catalyzed by unmodified firefly luciferase when concentrations of one of the substrates, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), are gradually increased. The temporal color change from green to red occurs within the first few minutes of the luciferase reaction when an ATP-containing solution is either added or synthesized in situ with the aid of an autocatalytic reaction occurring simultaneously. This color change is not accompanied by pH changes.

It is the structure of the particular luciferase enzyme that is the key to determining the color of the emitted light. We report here the molecular cloning of the P. scintillans luc gene and the expression and characterization of the corresponding novel recombinant luciferase enzyme. A comparison of the amino acid sequence with that of the highly similar P. pyralis enzyme and subsequent mutagenesis studies revealed that the single conservative amino acid change tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 255 accounted for the entire emission color difference. Additional mutagenesis and crystallographic studies were performed on a H‚Äêbond network, which includes the position 255 residue and five other stringently conserved beetle luciferase residues, that is proximal to the substrate/emitter binding site.

Morya, Lilian Lira Lisboa, Lucia Maria not provided Costa Monteiro, Reginaldo Ant√¥nio de Oliveira Freitas J√∫nior', 'Children with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) present brain abnormalities that include the cortical level (RIBEIRO, 2018) and can compromise the integrity of their conexions with the urinary and digestive systems, making them susceptible to bowel and bladder dysfunctions. Studies have confirmed the presence of neurogenic bladder in children with microcephaly and CZS (COSTA MONTEIRO, 2018; 2019). Considering the frequent association between bladder and bowel dysfunctions (MACHADO, 2016), their common embrionary origin and their similar sympathetic (L1-L3) and parasympathetic (S2-S4) innervation, it would be expected that patients with CZS and neurogenic bladder may also present bowel dysfunction. However, we didnt find published studies that have specifically addressed bowel dysfunction in children with CZS and bladder dysfunction. Therefore, we developed and tested this research protocol, based on accumulated knowledge in the treatment of patients with neurogenic bowel for other causes, and also in the treatment of patients with CZS. This protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee (CAAE-17583419.7.0000.5537) and has been used as part of the investigation methodology of bowel dysfunction in CZS children admitted for ambulatory follow-up on Anita Garibaldi Center of Education and Research in Health (CEPS). The Bowel Function Assessment Protocol includes extended clinical anamnesis with guiding questions related to signals and symptoms of functionals disturbances, detailed physical examination, Bristol scale and rectal ampoule ultrasound. This protocol is part of a research in progress at CEPS. Our preliminary data, under protection to be published, suggest that neurogenic bowel dysfunction can be a sequel of CZS. By making this research protocol public, we hope to encourage the reproduction of this research by other groups and empower scientific knowledge in the field of CZS.

Exclusion Cri teria Children with other malformations not related to CZS; Children with Genetic syndromes; Newborns and children younger than 1 year of age; Fail to sign the informed consent form. 1 After confirming the inclusion criteria, the initial assessment includes 5 steps: 1. Detai led cl inical history, re lated to water intake and food routine , including any special dietet ic regimen to bowel emptying. 2 2. Detai led cl inical history, re lated to bowel habits, including: Frequency of bowel emptying (evacuation diary), which is one of confirming constipation criteria. The color and the aspect of feces, showing the Bristol Stool Scale to facilitate identification by the accompanied adult. Use of bowel emptying maneuvers. Use of laxative, suppositories and enemas. History of intestinal lavage. Problems and side effects related to intestinal constipation (hemorrhoids, anal fissures and/or rectal bleeding). Facial expression of pain and crying during evacuation. Excessive retention history (fewer than two per week) Retentive posturing. 2.1 Retentive posturing may be adopted by the child in an attempt to withholding evacuation. It is important to observe it during consultation and call the family attention to it. Among the most common postures are: the child standing on tiptoe, holding the legs and buttocks rigidly, and most often moving the body back and forth, screaming, sweating and reddened the face from straining. Sometimes parents may misinterpreted these postures as a child attempted to defecate. 2.2 Bristol Stool Scale (LEWIS; HEATON, 1997) It is a visual classification measure that helps patients and their guardians to report feces appearance and consistency. It aims to describe and evaluate the fecal contents using pictures, which represent seven types of feces, according to its shapes and consistency. This scale contains images that illustrate the stools, and also accurate descriptions of shape and consistency, using examples easily recognizable. It was used the version of the scale validated for Brazil (MARTINEZ, 2012). When feces are classified as type one or two by Bristol Stool Scale, patient is considered to have acute or chronic constipation and fecal impaction, requiring treatments. Type three, four and five are considered in normality. Type six and seven are considered diarrheal stools, but also can be observed in patients with fecal impaction, when diarrheal stools pass around the fecal matter (CAMPBELL, 2005). 2 07/09/2020 Cita tion : Valeria Azevedo De Almeida, Nancy Sotero, Rafael Pauletti Gon√É‚Äã√Ç¬ßalves, Edgard Morya, Lilian Lira Lisboa, Lucia Maria Costa Monteiro, Reginaldo Ant√É‚Äã√Ç ÃÅnio de Oliveira Freitas J√É‚Äã√Çonior (07/09/2020).

Physical examination General physical examination with focus on the abdomen: the child should be positioned in supine position, comfortable, chest and abdomen exposed, with legs and arms extended. Before the procedures beginning, professionals should warm their hands and explain the procedure to the child and their companions. On the abdominal examination, in addition to external inspection and conventional palpation of organs and abdominal cavity, it is important to observe the presence of hypertimpanism during percussion, which can mean from gas retention to intestinal obstruction. Observe the child‚Äôs reaction to abdominal palpation (facial expression of pain and crying), if the abdomen is distended or if there are palpable masses, especially at the height of the sigmoid colon, which can correspond to fecal matter impacted. It is recommended to realize anus inspection, such as perianal region, to keep away the presence of hemorrhoids and fissures, commons among patients with bowel constipation, just like any anatomical alterations such as anal stricture, anteriorzed anus and absence of anal folds. 4 4.

Jimmy was a pet project of Egerton. He was an off-the-shelf clean room assembly bot that Egerton had modified into a somewhat old fashioned service bot. Egerton had been experimenting with Jimmy during his free evenings. At a little over three feet, Jimmy was a cute little guy. His rounded hip joints and oversize half-skull made him teeter when he moved across the floor. He looked like a child just learning to walk. ‚Äò‚ÄòHow are you feeling?‚Äô‚Äô Egerton asked Jimmy. ‚Äò‚ÄòFine thanks,‚Äô‚Äô he replied, mixing the gin and tonic. ‚Äò‚ÄòWe‚Äôre running low on Tanqueray.‚Äô‚Äô He turned and waddled a few steps with the drink, concentrated and careful not to spill. ‚Äò‚ÄòThanks.‚Äô‚Äô Egerton took the drink and searched the bot for anything out of the ordinary. ‚Äò‚ÄòNo problem at all.‚Äô‚Äô Jimmy waddled back to the makeshift bar and tidied up.

After a moment he asked, ‚Äò‚ÄòJimmy, will you fix me a drink?‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòNo problem,‚Äô‚Äô Jimmy replied cheerfully and started on the tenth drink. Egerton puzzled at the back of the little bot. He knew that Jimmy knew he was not drinking the gins. Egerton knew that Jimmy knew he was being tested and that it was silly to keep on making gin after gin. But Jimmy would not react. He would not break out of his service duties and ask what was going on. Why was not Egerton drinking the cocktails? Was there something wrong with them? It was a problem of will: free will. Jimmy had all the capabilities to question what was going on but he would not do it. It was a problem Egerton had been trying to crack for over 6 months. ‚Äò‚ÄòWe‚Äôre running low on Tanqueray,‚Äô‚Äô Jimmy said finishing the drink.

He was neither a good professor nor a good mentor but Egerton had learned a lot from the pompous old man.

Maguire, E. Briard, Y. Auberson, G. Tamagnan', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the brain distribution and kinetics of siponimod (BAF312) by using an iodine-labeled analogue of siponimod, [ 123 I]MS565, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in non-human primates (NHP).\n BACKGROUND: Siponimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P-1,5) receptor modulator currently in Phase 3 development for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Experimental studies in rats showed that siponimod penetrates into the CNS (4-8 hours post-administration) and may result in direct beneficial effects by acting on S1P-1 and/or -5 receptor expressing cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n DESIGN/METHODS: [ 123 I]MS565 (radioactive half-life of 13.2-hours) was administered to 2 adult male rhesus NHPs ( Macaca mulatta ), as single intravenous bolus. SPECT studies were performed using a MollyQ camera (Neurophysics Inc., Shirley, MA, USA). Brain penetration was assessed by serial dynamic scanning over a 2-day period following radiotracer injection. Scan duration was approximately 8-hours on Day 1 and 2-hours on Day 2 with a 24-hour interval between the last scan on Day 1 and the first scan on Day 2. SPECT images were corrected for motion, decay and tissue attenuation. The scans were reconstructed and analyzed using PMOD 3.405 software. Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated by normalizing for injected activity and body weight. Subsequently, images were co-registered to a MRI template for volumes of interest extraction, time-activity curves generation and brain penetration estimation. Blood samples were taken to determine the radio-metabolite concentration in plasma.\n RESULTS: Following intravenous bolus injection, [ 123 I]MS565 penetrated NHP brain with highest concentration in brain of 0.008-0.014 %ID/mL at around 24-hours post-injection. Peak SUV values of around 0.6-0.8 were also determined during day 2 imaging session. Radiotracer metabolism in plasma was slow and at 24-hours post-injection ~70% of parent compound was still present in rhesus monkey plasma.\n CONCLUSIONS: [ 123 I]MS565 is a promising SPECT imaging agent to investigate the potential CNS distribution of siponimod. Whole-body imaging is ongoing to obtain radiation absorbed dose estimates for [ 123 I]MS565.\n Study Supported by: Novartis Pharma AG\n Disclosure: Dr. Tavares has received personal compensation for activities with Molecular Neuroimaging as an employee.

The purpose of this study is to describe COVID patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and quantify their rehabilitation outcomes to determine if they benefit from inpatient rehabilitation to the same extent as their non-COVID counterparts.¬† \n \nMethods: This is a historical prospective observational study of all inpatients from a free standing, 128-bed rehabilitation hospital between February 29, 2020 and September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria are: ¬≥18 years of age and admission and discharge within the study time frame. The initial search yielded 920 patients; 896 met the inclusion criteria. Data was derived from the eRehabData database. Patients were stratified by COVID status (+/-) and rehabilitation impairment (Stroke/Brain Injury, Spinal Cord Injury/Disease, Orthopedic, Medically Complex). Data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS), discharge location, and functional ability measures for self-care and mobility (FA-SC, FA-Mob). Descriptive statistics included age, BMI, gender, LOS, and discharge location. One-sample t-tests were used to assess the difference of age, BMI, LOS, FA-SC, FA-Mob, and FA efficiency between COVID+ and COVID- patients.¬† \n \nFindings: COVID+ patients were younger (59¬∑40 years vs 62¬∑95 years; t(894)= -2¬∑05, p=0¬∑04) with a higher mean BMI (31¬∑66 vs 28¬∑45; t(894)= 3¬∑51, p<0¬∑01) than COVID- patients. COVID(+) patients, regardless of impairment group, had equivalent or superior improvements in FA-SC and FA-Mob, functional change efficiency, and LOS than COVID- patients. Specifically, comparing Medically Complex patients, those with COVID had greater FA-SC and FA-Mob efficiencies than COVID- patients. COVID+ patients had similar rates of return to the community.¬† \n \nInterpretation: Patients with COVID who meet the admission criteria for inpatient rehabilitation can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation similarly to their non-COVID counterparts with similar rehabilitation-specific diagnoses.¬†Funding This study did not utilize any funding source. \n \nFunding Statement: This study did not utilize any funding source. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: Cynthia T.

Sharma has been inspiring popularizing and researching in applicable mathematics. In this title one may feeling that there is a umpteen trend of mathematics today. We are attempting every event in the universe and in human life through mathematical modeling. It is real fact that mathematician is really missing in it today. I feel that mathematics is the motivation and learning of science, social science and Engineering. Mathematics is the science and art of life and world activities. Mathematical activity has changes a lot of last 60 years. Almost all human activity make and more use of mathematics. Mathematics activity has changes a lot of size in the field of research, applications, education, medical science etc. The contents in the talk are divided as following. 1. Potential agencies for employment. 2. Nature of education. 3. Analysis of the profile. 4. Remedies for better opportunities. Potential Agencies Trend of mathematics can be mainly classified employment opportunities as following. 1. Teaching department. 2. Research institutions. 3. Government and autonomous organization. 4. Private sector. 5. Computer industries. Each of institute needs persons good in mathematics and he know applicable mathematics is such field in which they are attached. Mathematics has vide potential and good practiced at these work places. Present students in mathematics go to teaching institution. NBHI identified ten thrust areas for learning in mathematics. A. Computational aspect algebra and geometry. B. Stochastic process modeling. C. Numerical scheme of solution of differential equation. D. Deterministic control theory. E. Dynamical system. F. Stochastic modeling process. G. Combinatorial optimization. H. Game theory. I. Wavelet theory. J. Spectral and inverse spectral theory. The basic issues that arises in who is to practices. We have to bring out state of the art in mathematics. Nature of education Mathematics for engineering students 1. Engineering students mathematician do not convey mathematics in their language. 2. Mathematics teacher fails to inspire and motivating students in the subjects. 3. Fine aspects of mathematics distaste the students. IJTSRD31130 International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (IJTSRD) @ www.ijtsrd.com eISSN: 2456-6470 @ IJTSRD | Unique Paper ID ‚Äì IJTSRD31130 | Volume ‚Äì 4 | Issue ‚Äì 4 | May-June 2020 Page 651 4. Many P.G. centers of engineering faculty has taken over the teaching of mathematics. Mathematics for commerce and management There is a great demand to dilute the subject because students are averse to learn mathematics. Mathematics for humanity and biosciences In these branches students have little touch with mathematics. Elementary statistics form a nucleas for analysis of data. Mathematics for physical science A. Physics syllabus has a good component of mathematics. B. Chemical sciences of graduate level is sufficient background for their purposes. C. Today students of physics believe high speed computing should be adopted in place of mathematical method. Mathematics for mathematical sciences 1. Computer science. A. Student Attend to software and hardware learning. B. Minimum syllabus does not inspire them. 2. Statistics A. Industries used good package for analysis. B. Courses are strong in mathematical analysis. C. Large of students decrease content in mathematics. 3. mathematics Primary and school level A. There is a large number of dropout due to mathematics. B. Failure rate is very high. C. The presentation and understanding of mathematics is not good in children. D. Why it is tought? E. The cause of literacy cannot achieved as mathematics is not applicable to students. High secondary level A. The good brain intends to drift to professional courses. B. Teaching is mark oriented. C. Oriented tutorial is handicap to analytical teaching. D. Teaching too adept this teaching and are busy in tutioring. College and university level A. Students are fall out of professional branch. B. Students are uninspired as employment opportunities in their subject. C. College teacher shrink research of real system projects. D. Tuition is high practice. E. Teachers are shifting interest to computing where professional scope is good. Analysis of the above profile Every organization has a scope to seek modeling advice to further it progress. It is actual fact that mathematicians do not understand our languor in the field of employing agencies. They are not able to develop mathematical model for real systems. There is a lot of gap in understanding each other. Mathematics community feels that mathematics shall remain what it is society has to accept this fact. Popularization of mathematics needs to be given high priority of scientific progress of the society. Remedies for better opportunities All the level of mathematical equations is seen as following; 1. Primary education in mathematics should be simple language and without abstract notations. 2. Middle level education should include and cover syllabus on unitary operation including orals on than. 3. In secondary level children are to be provided guidance and psychological test of their subject. 4. In higher secondary level in all branches for studies in mathematics with lab work is to be a paper. 5. In graduate level mathematical model making as a practical work in each area to be included. 6. In engineering mathematics should be model approach. 7. P.G. level teaching should have an advanced level computer programming course. Seminar for students is a good factor for understanding and development. Project work is equivalent to a paper is desirable. Class room teaching is to be decreased. Finally we say that decreasing of faith one another is a concern and is to be re-established. Reference [1] K. C.

Tyurbeeva', 'Remote sensing of the Earth (RSE) is one of the main objective sources of information about the earths surface. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it became possible to take aerial photos with high spatial resolution, which can more accurately identify objects. But due to the fact that the mass use of UAVs for remote sensing of the Earth has become relatively recent, there are no ready-made solutions for automated processing of UAV images. The purpose of the study is to increase the reliability of interpretation of UAV images by developing a method of automated processing based on conceptual modeling. Analysis of methods for thematic interpretation of UAV images showed that none of them provides sufficient segmentation quality without additional adjustment to the subject area. It was found that a combination of methods will improve the result of interpretation. When developing the method of automated processing of UAV images and its software implementation, the method of conceptual modeling of subject problems was used, which ensures the adequacy of syntactic representations (including various images), allows you to control the logic of solving problems and reduces the number of errors at the stage of its software implementation. Using the error matrix and the formula for calculating the Kappa Cohen index, the reliability of thematic interpretation of images of forest areas was assessed. 59 (52.2%) of the 113 trees shown in the picture were correctly identified by the standard watershed method, and 80 (70.8%) - by the developed method. Thus, the developed method made it possible to improve the identification of forest objects in UAV images by 18.6%. In the future, the development of this method can be carried out to determine the characteristics of the identified trees: age, species, height, timber stock.', '2020', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=fact+facts+nbsp+photo+photos+facebook+aerial&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 63),

A ‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù report was published, which included statistics on the extent of content removal, organized by category. Let‚Äôs look at for instance the category ‚ÄúGraphic Violence‚Äù: ‚ÄúIn Q1 2018, we took action on a total of 3.4 million pieces of content, an increase from 1.2 million pieces of content in Q4 2017. This increase is mostly due to improvements in our detection technology, including using photo-matching to cover with warnings photos that matched ones we previously marked as disturbing. These actions were responsible for around 70% of the increase in Q1‚Äù. The numbers may seem high, but they only tell half the story. Another graph in the report shows that 71.56% of the 1.2 million users were tracked by Facebook itself, until user complaints started flooding in; in the first quarter of 2018, this figure rose to 85.6%. The fact that the number of removals tripled means that content removed because of user complaints rose from 341,000 to almost 500,000, in absolute figures, despite the decrease in percentage. So, the increase can be attributed not only to better tracking equipment, but also to more complaints favored. These numbers are a testimony to content removal on a disproportionately large scale, also known as censorship.', '2019', 2, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=fact+facts+nbsp+photo+photos+facebook+aerial&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 63),

This relies on the fact that most of the spaces are designed for human navigation. As a result, they are filled with visual cues. In this sense, visual recognition is an essential ability to avoid obstacles when an autonomous vehicle interacts with the real world. Data collection using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) navigating in a real-world scenario is a high-cost and time-expensive activity. For this reason, one of the most valuable assets of technology companies is a database containing locations and interactions. One solution to this problem is the adoption of a photo-realistic 3D simulator as a data source. Using this resource, it is possible to gather a significant amount of data. Therefore, this research creates a dataset for instance segmentation using images from a frontal UAV camera navigating in a 3D simulator. This work applies a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, the Mask-RCNN. The architecture takes an image input and predicts per-pixel instance segmentation. Experimental results showed that Mask RCNN has superior performance in our dataset when refining a model trained using COCO dataset.

With such capabilities, Facebook is a suitable tool for various abuses and for committing various offenses. It is a common situation for users to post different statuses, photos, snapshots through profiles, or post comments on statuses, photos or snapshots, of offensive content. From the point of view of our positive criminal law, the criminal protection of the honor and reputation of the individual, as intangible human values, is not in dispute in these situations.

In-depth interviews were administered to few accessible participants at Jamhuriya University who were knowledgeable about these companies‚Äô Facebook engagements. Desk review was adopted in order to obtain scholarly materials on social media posts and particularly Facebook. Key findings in this study indicate that video posts receive more comments and likes than other posts like photos for reasons valued by the respective customers. Facebook fans, mostly young people such as students and youth tend to enjoy action related posts than photos. Findings further reveal that Facebook interaction is at the peak during midyear for three months of June, July and August. This is attributed to the fact that this is usually summer time, the time when most Somalis in the diaspora come home for vacation perhaps largely attracted to various events taking place in the country. Findings also indicate that social media addicts in Mogadishu start commenting on Facebook as early as 4am in the morning, some of these are Facebook fans who find it hard to sleep again after 4am prayers.

Borys', 'ABSTRACT Background: We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of 2 + 1 infant regimens initiated with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and completed with the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV). Methods: This partially blinded study randomized 6‚Äì12-week-old infants to receive two-dose priming and a booster (at ages 2, 4, 12‚Äì15 months) with: PCV13 at priming and PHiD-CV at boosting (PPS); PCV13 then PHiD-CV at priming and PHiD-CV at boosting (PSS); or PHiD-CV at priming and boosting (SSS control). All analyses were descriptive, i.e., no statistical significance tests were done. Results: The total vaccinated cohort at priming comprised 294 infants. Grade 3 adverse events were reported after 8.7% (PPS), 11.4% (PSS), and 16.9% (SSS) of primary doses (primary objective). No serious adverse events were considered vaccination-related. For most PHiD-CV serotypes, observed percentages of children reaching antibody concentrations ‚â•0.2 ¬µg/mL and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers above cutoffs were similar across groups 1 month post-priming and post-booster. Observed geometric mean antibody concentrations and OPA titers were lower for some PHiD-CV serotypes with the mixed regimens than with PHiD-CV only, especially for PSS. However, no tests of statistical significance were performed. Conclusions: Immunogenicity of the two mixed PCV13/PHiD-CV regimens seemed mostly similar to that of a PHiD-CV-only series, although observed antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs for some PHiD-CV serotypes were lower. No safety concerns were raised. The clinical relevance of the observed differences is unknown. Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01641133 Plain Language Summary Focus on the patient What is the context? Infant immunization programs worldwide include the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines Synflorix and Prevnar 13 to help combat pneumococcal diseases. Countries or regions choose whether to use Synflorix or Prevnar 13 and may decide to switch from one vaccine to the other. This can result in infants receiving a mixed vaccination regimen. Limited information is available about such mixed regimens. What is new? We assessed the immunogenicity of three infant vaccination regimens: 1) priming with two doses of Prevnar 13 and boosting with Synflorix; 2) priming with one dose of Prevnar 13 followed by one dose of Synflorix and boosting with Synflorix; 3) priming and boosting with Synflorix. The study showed that: Switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix at any time during the vaccination regimen did not seem to affect safety. When switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix at the time of boosting, immunogenicity was mostly similar to that of the Synflorix- only regimen. Switching vaccines during priming resulted in a trend toward lower immune responses for some vaccine components. What is the impact? This piece of evidence can be considered by doctors and health authorities when evaluating the possibility of switching pneumococcal vaccines in an immunization program or individual immunization regimen. Further effectiveness studies from countries or regions switching from Prevnar 13 to Synflorix (or vice versa) may shed more light on the feasibility of switching between these vaccines.', '2020', 1, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=vaccine+vaccinated+vaccination+vaccines+vaccinations+children+said+trials+trial+macklom+mackloms&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 28),

Turnbull, N. Redmond, P. Lucas, C. Cabral, J. Ingram, S. Hollinghurst, A. Hay, T. Peters, J. Horwood, P. Little, N. Francis, P. Blair', 'Introduction While most respiratory tract infections (RTIs) will resolve without treatment, many children will receive antibiotics and some will develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation. There have been calls for evidence to reduce uncertainty regarding the identification of children who will and will not benefit from antibiotics. The aim of this feasibility trial is to test recruitment and the acceptance of a complex behavioural intervention designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing, and to inform how best to conduct a larger trial. Methods and analysis The CHICO (Childrens Cough) trial is a single-centre feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a web-based, within-consultation, behavioural intervention with usual care for children presenting to general practitioner practices with RTI and acute cough. The trial aims to recruit at least 300 children between October 2014 and April 2015, in a single area in South West England. Following informed consent, demographic information will be recorded, and symptoms and signs measured. Parents/carers of recruited children will be followed up on a weekly basis to establish symptom duration, resource use and cost of the illness to the parent until the childs cough has resolved or up to 8‚ÄÖweeks, whichever occurs earlier. A review of medical notes, including clinical history, primary care reconsultations and hospitalisations will be undertaken 2‚ÄÖmonths after recruitment. The trial feasibility will be assessed by: determining acceptability of the intervention to clinicians and parent/carers; quantifying differential recruitment and follow-up; determining intervention fidelity; the success in gathering the data necessary to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; and collecting data about antibiotic prescribing rates to inform the sample size needed for a fully powered RCT. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the North West‚ÄîHaydock Research Ethics Committee, UK (reference number: 14/NW/1034). The findings from this feasibility trial will be disseminated through research conferences and peer-reviewed journals.

Data were collected using a face-to-face interview. The main variables of interest were satisfaction with job, working and living conditions, intention to leave and factors associated with a decision to leave. In addition to descriptive analysis, multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with job satisfaction and turnover intention.ResultsConsidering everything, only 39.2% of physicians and 48.8% of health officers were satisfied with their job. Moreover, 47.5% of physicians and 61.4% of health officers said they planned to leave their job within one year. Low pay, poor access to higher education, and limited opportunities for promotion were ranked as the three most important reasons for a decision to leave. The odds of job satisfaction was higher among health officers than physicians. It was also higher among respondents who perceived facility management & leadership, salary & benefits, and recognition by the community more favorably. The likelihood of intention to leave was lower among respondents with more positive perception of facility management & leadership and their own living conditions.ConclusionsThe level of dissatisfaction and turnover intention among physicians and health officers is considerable driven largely by poor leadership & management, salary, and living conditions.', '2020', 0, 'https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=seattle+citys+city+news+said+officers&limit=10&fields=title,authors,abstract,year,citationCount', 19);
