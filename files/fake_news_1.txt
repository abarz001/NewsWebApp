 Donald Trump Jr. is taking aim at a longtime family foe — he’s hawking a t-shirt that uses a tragic movie-set shooting to mock Alec Baldwin, who famously skewered his father on “Saturday Night Live.”   

 A tee declaring “Guns Don’t Kill People, Alec Baldwin Kills People” is selling for $27.99 on a merchandise site linked to the former president’s namesake son. The reference is to the Thursday slaying of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was hit by discharge from a prop gun while working on the Baldwin film “Rust.”     Advertisement

 Trump Jr.’s merchandise site also sells shirts that read “My God, My Family, My Guns &amp; My Freedom.” The 43-year-old scion is a vocal gun advocate who frequently poses with firearms and posts photos of animals he’s killed. Last year, he hosted an Alaskan hunting trip to raise money for Safari Club International.                  Advertisement       

 The t-shirt Trump Jr. is pushing is in line with anti-Baldwin comments the former reality TV judge made on social media over the weekend. He suggested Sunday that Baldwin, a politically active progressive, would blame the gun for Hutchins’ being shot. Some like-minded Instagram users weighed in to suggest — without any evidence — that the killing was no accident.   

 Trump Jr. stuck to his guns amid criticism the t-shirt was in poor taste.             

 “Screw all the sanctimony I’m seeing out there,” he said on Instagram. “If the shoe was on the other foot Alex (sic) Baldwin would literally be the first person p--sing on everybody’s grave trying to make a point. F*ck him!”   

 As of Monday former President Donald Trump, who announced last week he was launching a new social media platform, had not commented on the matter.        

 But some right-wing pundits teed up on Baldwin after Hutchins’ death. Commentator Candace Owens accused Baldwin of the “murder” of “innocent people,” which she later corrected.          This t-shirt, which appears to mock the death of a woman on the set of a western starring Alec Baldwin, is being sold on a website linked to Donald Trump Jr.      

 GOP Colorado congresswoman Lauren Boebert and Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance mocked Baldwin, with the latter asking that Donald Trump be reinstated on Twitter so he could address his TV tormentor.   

 Those comments drew fire from Vance’s Democratic rival in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan, who tweeted “Someone died, you a--hole.”   

 Even Fox News host Janice Dean urged Vance to take down his tweet.     

 Baldwin’s impression of Trump on “SNL” angered the ex-president, who questioned the long-running program’s legality in a 2018 Twitter rant about “unfair news coverage.”   

 Trump and Baldwin feuded on Twitter in March of that year with the 45th president claiming the actor’s “dying mediocre career” was revived by his impersonation of the commander-in-chief.

 Baldwin tweeted his feelings of “shock and sadness” following Thursday’s fatal shooting and said he was cooperating with investigators. He had reportedly been told the firearm was “cold.”   

 According to a new affidavit, Baldwin was training his pistol on a camera when the shot was fired from his gun. “Rust” director Joel Souza reportedly claimed Baldwin was rehearsing a “cross draw” at the time of the killing. The filmmaker said he was looking over Hutchins’ shoulder and heard “a whip and then loud pop” before the two of them were struck.     

 CNN reported camera operator Reid Russell heard Hutchins say she could not “feel her legs” as medics tried in vain to keep her alive. He also said in an affidavit that Baldwin “had been very careful” handling the gun on set.

 Hilaria Baldwin, the 63-year-old actor’s wife, tweeted Monday her sympathies for Hutchins, her family and her own husband, as well.   

 “My heart is with Halyna,” she wrote Monday on Instagram. “Her husband. Her son. Their family and loved ones. And my Alec.”     Howard Stern mocks the ‘wisdom’ of Donald Trump Jr.: You can’t argue with a genius like that’ »     

 A pair of vigils were held for Hutchins over the weekend. One took place in New Mexico, where she died. The other took place in Burbank, Calif., outside the International Cinematographers Guild. Her death inspired a push for safer film sets where guns are used.   

 People magazine reported a “hysterical and absolutely inconsolable” Baldwin had pulled out of upcoming projects while he tried to pull himself together. The victim’s husband, Matthew Hutchins, was photographed hugging Baldwin outside a Santa Fe Hotel where they’d reportedly met.

Hutchins and her husband were married 16 years and have a 9-year-old son.
