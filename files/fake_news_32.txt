He was clearly the kind of kid who, if losing a board game, would just knock all the pieces on the floor. 8.1k ReplyShareReportSavelevel 2  ·  20d 

He&#x27;d spend real money to buy Monopoly money just to win. 2.3k ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d He was clearly the kind of kid who, if losing a board game, would just knock all the pieces on the floor.

Well yeah.  That was also his brand of diplomacy and foreign policy.  &quot;Take my ball and go home.&quot; 237 ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d 

When he&#x27;s &quot;losing&quot; at an interview (i.e. he&#x27;s being asked questions he can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t answer) he walks out. 555 ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d 

IRL he acts worse then that. He once stole the golf score from a kid playing on his course. 167 ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d Democrats: &quot;My knight takes your queen.&quot;

Trump: plays an Uno reverse card

Democrats: &quot;You can&#x27;t do that, that&#x27;s not chess!&quot;

Republicans: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing in the rules that says you can&#x27;t play Uno cards.&quot;

Packed Supreme Court: &quot;Well allow it.&quot;

Democrats: &quot;Fine. We&#x27;ll move our rook up.&quot;

Trump: builds a hotel on the space &quot;You owe me for landing on my property with a hotel!&quot;

Democrats: &quot;That&#x27;s...that&#x27;s not even how Monopoly works, let alone Chess!&quot;

Republicans: &quot;White pieces have executive privilege. Your black pieces are tresspassing.&quot;

Packed Supreme Court: finds somewhere else to look

Democrats: throws arms in air &quot;Fine! We&#x27;ll move our rook to check.&quot;

Trump: big smug stupid grin &quot;Lies. Just more lies. I&#x27;m not in check, you are.&quot;

Republicans: &quot;We&#x27;re actually the black side. You just put yourself in check. Look at all the rules you broke trying to win and you still lost!&quot;

51.3% of Public: &quot;The Democrats won that game by a wide margin.&quot;

Trump: &quot;Fake news! Democrats stole that win! We need to take back our game!&quot;

He is threatening the GOP.  “Get behind me and my messaging or I will destroy you.” 17.5k ReplyShareReportSavelevel 2  ·  20d Yep. Plain and simple.

Its either Trump&#x27;s way or the Highway.

Which is a battle they can&#x27;t win.  The courts are smacking this shit down left and right.  There will be no fraud proven in the 2020 election which means it&#x27;s a lose lose situation.  Now is the time more than ever to run AWAY from Trumpism. 2.6k ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d ·  edited 20d  

Fuck the gop, they kissed his ass for 4 years, now they can reap what they sow. 151 ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d ·  edited 20d  

Plus, since he&#x27;s not going to be democratically elected ever, he wants to be able to pretend it&#x27;s not lack of popularity. It will give his insurrection  a veneer of justification to his followers. 18 ReplyShareReportSaveContinue this thread  level 2  ·  20d 

Maybe he realizes he’ll be getting indicted before 2024 and “if I can’t have the Big Mac, nobody can!” 132 ReplyShareReportSaver/politics /r/Politics is for news and discussion about U.S. politics.7.8m
