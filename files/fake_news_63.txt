A photo shows an aerial drone display in Mexico City depicting a skull wearing a sombrero as part of celebrations for Día de los Muertos or Day of the Dead.                                                            Our verdict

This didn’t happen. There’s no other evidence the event took place. The drone display is almost certainly a digital effect. The city in the photo isn’t Mexico City either—it was taken near Mount Fuji, Japan.

 suggests a group of aerial drones were lit-up and flown over Mexico City to&nbsp; resemble a skull wearing a sombrero for the Mexican holiday D&iacute;a de los Muertos or Day of the Dead, which takes place on 2 November.&nbsp;

The post includes an image of what appears to be a huge aerial display of the skull over a city and large mountain range. However, it&rsquo;s not real.

The image has been online since at least  and is almost certainly a digital or photo editing effect.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s possible to create aerial art displays using drones (such as those seen at the 2020 ) there appears to be no news coverage or other photos of this display that might confirm whether it happened.&nbsp;

The background of the display isn&rsquo;t of Mexico City either or anywhere else in the Americas; it was actually taken more than 7,000 miles away at Mount Fuji, Japan. An article by American fact checkers  states the original photo was taken  from the nearby Amariyama mountain range, while  the original picture dates back to at least 2012. Whether they are the same photos, there are  of similar  which confirm the photo in the Facebook post is of .&nbsp;

Based on the position of the mountain and  it appears that the city in the foreground is Kofu, the capital of the Yamanashi Prefecture (that make up Japan).&nbsp;

For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as                  because there’s no other evidence the event took place. It appears to be a digital effect applied to a photo of Mount Fuji, not Mexico City.
