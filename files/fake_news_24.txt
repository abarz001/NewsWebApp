&#8220;The use of colloquialism or saying with intended double meaning or offense are strictly prohibited in all means of correspondence and/or communication,&#8221; the letter said.

Further, it stated, &#8220;Specifically, the use of the wording, &#8216;Let&#8217;s Go Brandon&#8217; or any variation thereof under any circumstance is banned by the Canadian Public Service.&#8221;    

MORE NEWS:

This will be a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; issue, said the organization with no sense of humor. Additionally, violating the policy will result in &#8220;dismissal without recourse or labour union representation.&#8221; Canadian government workers must not say &quot;Let&#39;s Go Brandon&quot;, or any variation thereof, in any communication.

NO &#8220;smart&#8221; phone, NO tracking device, NO Qr code, NO virus. 
 Kill the beast now and while you are at it destroy that damn Teeeeeee Veeeeeee too.
 &nbsp;
 If you have an evil ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone nesting like a viper in your pocket or tightly grasped in your simian fist as if it were some kind of extirpated still pulsating body appendage or brain abortion as the case may be, then you are part of the problem and will never contribute anything of worth to stop the real zombie virus that is leading the herd of mutton over the cliff, at least not until you smash your personalized tracking demon to bits. Slouching naked apes thumb jabbing their hand held thingies and drooling over their idiot gizmos are no longer fully human, rather mindless mutton-headed interfaces with nobody home, or seldom available as they spend their pathetic half-lives peering down the black hole of their tacky, third rate NWO Chinese junk shop virtual ‚Äúreality‚Äù. It‚Äôs like listening to East Germans, that were surveilled by STASI psychopaths 24/7 before the Wall was moved, explaining how free they became (at least until 2 years back) even as they exhibit the same nauseating ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone ticks and prosthetic brain addictions as their thoroughly brainwashed cousins in the West while they themselves, without question, pay through the nose for this constant monitoring of their lives and interference from goons and &#8220;nudging&#8221; by the psychopaths that own the so-called &#8220;social media platforms&#8221; of Fecesbook, Twatter, EweTueb, Goggle and ilk&#8230;&#8221;safe&#8221; spaces where the sheeple bleat.
 &nbsp;
 Though the STASI orphans should have known better, they too have already been consumed whole by trans humanist Mickey Mouse BS so the logical next step for the reptilians in charge is to pump their graphene oxide and nano dirt directly to their ovine brains and put them under complete remote control where monkey man never again has to miss a Twatter outburst or a Goggle command or Fecesbook &#8220;breaking news&#8221; fart or whatever crap they get from their blinking, prosthetic, vital organ when they deep dive into their amoled glass swamp. By all means you four-legged critters of the herd do download the &#8220;essential updates&#8221; in your monthly covaids ‚Äúbooster‚Äù death vaxx squirt to become a truly fulfilled silicon meat puppet like the rest of the protoplasm squirming around you. Your viper in residence and its Qr coded commands (straight from the hell that you couldn&#8217;t wait to jump into) will indeed award you with the appropriate Chicom slash NWO credits for being an obedient and soulless slave of the hell on Earth they are now erecting for the dying herd as the last stage of this dystopian farce plays out.
 &nbsp;
 Otherwise kill your diabolic ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone or shut up already. If you can‚Äôt do something that simple yourself, as one who claims to ‚Äúget it‚Äù, then why should you expect the herd not to willfully poison itself considering they are no longer in control of anything in their miserable existences other than shoving stuff in their facial orifice or squeezing shit out their sphincter end as the case may be, in between perusing their &#8220;smart&#8221; phone smut and kitty litter videos, as they proudly and dutifully exhibit their covaids death squirt status Qr code to every jackbooted robopig thug that demands compliance as they go about their shameful and soon to be terminated lives&#8230;all in the prurient interest of course of the demons that unleashed this genocide and &#8220;watched over by machines of love and grace&#8221;. When the 5G towers and soon the 6G towers light up in the coming Dark Winter then the real electronic gulag will become apparent to even the most challenged leg of mutton out there in the pathetic human herd.
 &nbsp;
 Never let any psychopath in your pocket or your life that is obviously &#8220;smarter&#8221; than you.
 &nbsp;

 ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù phone macht dumb
 But PfiZer macht frei &#8230;. permanently
