The license plate honors Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are credited with the first flight in a manned aircraft.

The department sent out a tweet acknowledging the mistake. We are aware that the plane on the new Ohio license plate unveiled this morning was oriented in the wrong direction. We regret this mistake and have fixed the image. This is the correct design that will be reflected on all new plates issued to Ohio drivers. ⬇️
