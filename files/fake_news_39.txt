 “Red light, green light”: It turns out that the creepy doll can be found at a horse carriage museum and park just a few hours outside of Seoul in Chungcheongbok-do, South Korea. 


The “Squid Game” production team reportedly borrowed the doll from the Jincheon Carriage Museum, also known as Macha Land, and gave it back after filming. 

However, in an update on the museum’s website, the robot doll will no longer be displayed at the park,  SAYS   reported. 

The manufacturer initially handed the doll over to the museum for private storage, but miscommunication led to the doll being displayed for public viewing following the premiere of the drama. 

Macha Land has since wrapped up the doll to be returned into storage.


 Viral success: “Squid Game” has generated several TikTok videos and amassed billions of views, with many parodying the games from the show.
